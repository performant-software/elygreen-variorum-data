                  <line>I was born in a Small town in Tenn the name Sewanee:</line>
                  <line>So called. The University of the South. It was was 1893.</line>
                  <line>My father was a white man. My mother was so called</line>
                  <line>a negress. So I was looked on as a half white bastard</line>
                  <line>and so called that by almost every one that knew me:</line>
                  <line>.In. this town many of the better class of white people, </line>
                  <line>often taken Negro boys-girl into their homes to train</line>
                  <line>them to be effecient help. This is how my mother </line>
                  <line>became a victim of this misfortune by producing me </line>
                  <line>when she was seventeen. She descovered she was pregnet</line>
                  <line>Her mistress sent her away. For me to be born.</line>
                  <line>After this event. My mother was taken in by another family.</line>
                  <line>by the name of Dr. Richerson. Who lived. next estate</line>
                  <line>to my fathers people: I have never known. Jest why</line>
                  <line>this kind couple should have so thoutful to mother.</line>
                  <line>They treated her as if she was one of the family. When I was</line>
                  <line>two years old my mother married. Then she brought</line>
                  <line>me to live on the estate with her. and husband</line>
                  <line>I was about three years old before I can remember</line>
                  <line>things that went on about me: My step father</line>
                  <line>was a fine man. He was so good to me although</line>
                  <line>I became to know that he was not my father at</line>
                  <line>four years old. Chrismas 1897. Usally my mother</line>
                  <line>taken me up to mother Richeson to work every day</line>
                  <line>their I would Play all over the house.. Mother Richeson</line>
                  <line>was very fond of me. She done lots of hand work</line>
                  <line>When I would do thinks wrong. She would. say </line>
                  <line>I drop a stitch find it there I would crawl over the</line>
                  <line>floor. hunting for the stitch. While both mothers</line>
                  <line>would laugh; So this Xmas there was to be company</line>
                  <line>for dinner. So my mother thought I would be in</line>
                  <line>the way of the guest. So She explained this to me,</line>
                  <line>Santa Claus had brought me some fire works</line>
                  <line>and toys I was most happy. She ask me to stay in</line>
                  <line>the servent quarters: until after dinner. And dont</line>
                  <line>touch the fire works: She dressed me in a little</line>
                  <line>plaid dress. And told me to stay in the house it was</line>
                  <line>bitter cold out side snow on the Ground. The drum</line>
                  <line>stove was red hot. When she left for work.</line>
               </surface>               
               <surface>
                  <line>She came back ever hour to see how I was: The stove.</line>
                  <line>was red from heat: So holding a roman candle in my hand</line>
                  <line>playing with it I let it touch the stove. And it lighted</line>
                  <line>and started to Sparkle. I tried to put it out it set my</line>
                  <line>dress afire. I ran to the door and threw the candle out I was</line>
                  <line>on fire. not knowing what to. I leapt in the bed and covered it.</line>
                  <line>This put the fire out: Later I got up and changed .dresses and hid</line>
                  <line>my burned dress in my box where I kept my clothes: Soon my</line>
                  <line>mother came with my dinner. like most all the cooks down</line>
                  <line>South feed their children from their jobs this is called toten.</line>
                  <line>She had some toys and lot of nickels that Mother Richerson and</line>
                  <line>the guest had sent me. while she was placing my dinner on</line>
                  <line>my littel table she smelled the burnt cloth. . Then she ask</line>
                  <line>me what happen. She wanted to know if I had shot any of</line>
                  <line>my fire works: I told her no. soon she found I had lied:</line>
                  <line>This was the first time I had ever remembered of eve being</line>
                  <line>whipt: by her: So when she stopt whipping me I ran</line>
                  <line>out in the snow screaming so loud that my mother had to</line>
                  <line>try. run me down to get me back in the house. before she could</line>
                  <line>reach me I had crawled through the bars of the big gate to the</line>
                  <line>adjoyning estate: That belong to my father people. There I</line>
                  <line>stood screaming. My mother stood coaxing me to come</line>
                  <line>back to her: She didn't wish to come through gate:</line>
                  <line>Some one spoke from the back of me. Asking my mother</line>
                  <line>what was she whipping me for. Mother replied he lied</line>
                  <line>to me and I spanked him and he ran away from me</line>
                  <line>over there. So this white lady taken me by my hand</line>
                  <line>house and come back to the gate she had something</line>
                  <line>for me at the house. So mother taken me in and</line>
                  <line>told me to stay untill she come back. She went out:</line>
                  <line>Soon she was back with lots oranges and candy and toys</line>
                  <line>She told me these were sent to you. I ask her who was the</line>
                  <line>lady. She looked at me for a moment. And said you might</line>
                  <line>as well know now. That was your grandmother</line>
                  <line>of your white family. She said for you to be a good</line>
                  <line>boy and dont tell storys to any one: This made me</line>
                  <line>very happy to think some else loved me, to. No farther</line>
                  <line>did I think of it. Later my step farther came he helpt</line>
                  <line>me shoot my fire works. I was so fond of him.</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>I did'nt have any children to play with. I had my mother and</line>
                  <line>father. They were like two pals. we didnt have any company.</line>
                  <line>except. My fathers friends that worked on the construction</line>
                  <line>When it rained. The men often came to the house to play</line>
                  <line>checkers. Which my step father was a good player.</line>
                  <line>no one had anything much to say to me: I was always</line>
                  <line>busy trying to build something are make somthing.</line>
                  <line>my mother when She was off the job she started me on my</line>
                  <line>alphebet when I was four years old. I had to count</line>
                  <line>every thing that came in the house. From my fathers</line>
                  <line>pay enelope. To the matches in boxs. Some times I</line>
                  <line>would complain. Then she would tell me that she wanted</line>
                  <line>me to be the best edjacated man in the world. When I would</line>
                  <line>go to mother Richeson house. I had to do the same thing: mother</line>
                  <line>Richeson when I was four and a half. Bought me a slate and started me</line>
                  <line>She called Father Gerry. To come and babtize me. The next</line>
                  <line>day Father came: With him came Bishop Gailor of Tenn.</line>
                  <line>and Father Clabourne. When they taken me in the parlor</line>
                  <line>I became frighten and tryed to run out. My mother caught</line>
                  <line>me and held on to me. They had on their corters and</line>
                  <line>gouns which I had never seen them dressed like this.</line>
                  <line>Mother Richinson and Bishop Gaitor kneelt by and told</line>
                  <line>me. I was a child of God and I must be babtized and</line>
                  <line>Bishop was my Godfarther- Mother Richeson was </line>
                  <line>my Godmother. and father Gerry and father Eastern</line>
                  <line>would be my consulman: When this was over I was</line>
                  <line>most happy to know that I had so many friends</line>
                  <line>I began to love every body: Hear I wish to explain</line>
                  <line>somthing about this town. As why the white people</line>
                  <line>were so democratic. Most of the people at this time</line>
                  <line>that lived here. Were English decent. There many of them</line>
                  <line>were nobility respect of England: The residental area was</line>
                  <line>fenced in no poor white people lived in side of this area:</line>
                  <line>No body lived there except the aristicrats and their servants.</line>
                  <line>all work s like house maids Butlers coachmans were all.</line>
                  <line>colored and most every one was call colored you</line>
                  <line>rarely ever heard the word ever used negro are nigger.</line>
                  <line>It seemed that every body was happy just to be there</line>
               </surface>
           
 
               
               <surface>
                  <line>When I was five years old my little brother was born.</line>
                  <line>In which. I became jelouis of imeditately. It seemed every</line>
                  <line>thing changed. Every way. People came to our house to</line>
                  <line>to see my little brother: Every one colored was so fond of.</line>
                  <line>him. Until this happend: There were so few women</line>
                  <line>ever come to see my mother: There were but few ever</line>
                  <line>had anything. To say to me. They would just look at</line>
                  <line>me as if I could not have been. My white family was</line>
                  <line>named Wicks. Some of the women would say to</line>
                  <line>the other he sure is a Wicks. He is just like them:</line>
                  <line>by the time I was Six Year old: I had become to under</line>
                  <line>stand that I just was nt like the rest of my family</line>
                  <line>I know my mother had become to notice my feeling. Though</line>
                  <line>she did not say anything to me concerning this: They gave</line>
                  <line>me more priviledges. I was allowed to go out in the</line>
                  <line>park and play withe the white children. when their</line>
                  <line>nurses brought then in the Park to play. many</line>
                  <line>times the mother s would come with their children. They</line>
                  <line>were all so kind to me you see the town was so</line>
                  <line>no houses had any numbers. every body knew</line>
                  <line>every body Black ore white: The white people had</line>
                  <line>every thing under such control. They knew every thing</line>
                  <line>so that was why that it seemed that every one knew</line>
                  <line>me and was so kind to me: So often they would</line>
                  <line>bring ice crem cookies. I would be sirved with their</line>
                  <line>children: This went on for about six months. Then my</line>
                  <line>mother told me that school was opening out of the</line>
                  <line>corporation and I should go. This was where most</line>
                  <line>of the colored people and the poor class of white</line>
                  <line>lived. So the first day she taken me to school so</line>
                  <line>I would know the way. I met the teecher. and I was</line>
                  <line>enrolled: For two weeks, I went to school. I did not</line>
                  <line>like school. Because the children didnt like me</line>
                  <line>I was the only real light complected one in</line>
                  <line>the school. The rumer soon was out that I was a</line>
                  <line>Bastard and that my white uncle was a knit witt</line>
                  <line>whome was called Clabber: Soon all the children</line>
                  <line>joked fun at me of this name: which vexed me very</line>
               </surface>
           
 
               
               <surface>
                  <line>much: My teacher was very kind to untill I started</line>
                  <line>to fight the kids when the the would tease me: I was</line>
                  <line>graded: placed in the second Reader: Just as I was</line>
                  <line>begenning to be come adjusted my mother taken</line>
                  <line>sick. She wanted me to stay with her. She had been</line>
                  <line>ailing every sice my brother was born. She never</line>
                  <line>went back to work. So I was glad not to go to school.</line>
                  <line>My mother was aflected with consumption: she know</line>
                  <line>She would never be well. This four month before</line>
                  <line>She got to weak she kept me with her almost every</line>
                  <line>minute: She would take my brother and and go up on</line>
                  <line>the main streets when the military student would</line>
                  <line>march. by. I thought that was the greatest somthing</line>
                  <line>that could be: To be a cadet. She talked so much about</line>
                  <line>this training. Sundy morning the cadets would march.</line>
                  <line>by music. by their band. like the West Point.</line>
                  <line>Cadets. So on Sundy mornings I would go up on</line>
                  <line>the street where they marched by: I was just two</line>
                  <line>blocks from St Agustus Chapel. Which they had to</line>
                  <line>march from where I would meet them. So I would</line>
                  <line>try to keep up with them untill they got to the chapel.</line>
                  <line>formation. Passing reveiw and salute their superiors.</line>
                  <line>I would stand some where and solute to.  Then march.</line>
                  <line>in the chapel. Every body always waited for the arival</line>
                  <line>of the cadets before going in the chapel. When they</line>
                  <line>marched in. I wouldnt go in the I would to the back</line>
                  <line>of the chapel to watch the orogan pumper pump the</line>
                  <line>pipe organ. I would wath him for a while. Then</line>
                  <line>I would go to my mother. After a few Sundays I</line>
                  <line>was spoken to by many white people; All white people</line>
                  <line>down South seems to love colored children. So one</line>
                  <line>morning their was a package left on our door step</line>
                  <line>I brought it in and gave it to my mother She open it</line>
                  <line>their was a little coat and cap somthing like the</line>
                  <line>cadets: So Sundy mornings I was always waiting</line>
                  <line>for cadets to pass. Seem every body would laugh.</line>
                  <line>when I pass by they would salute me when I salute</line>
                  <line>them. I do beleaive that was the happiest days of all</line>
                  <line>my life:</line>
               </surface>
           
 
               
               <surface>
                  <line>On Sundays my step father would be home with my</line>
                  <line>mother. That was why I could go away for a while:</line>
                  <line>I would come in and tell her how wonderful things</line>
                  <line>were. Very soon my mother became so sick that I</line>
                  <line>could not wait on her: Father had to get some.</line>
                  <line>one a woman to care for. I had my little brother</line>
                  <line>then to look after: Father built another room on</line>
                  <line>to the one we had been living in where we cooked</line>
                  <line>slept and bathed in: Father Gerry come Pastor of</line>
                  <line>St Agustus came every morning. He and Dr Hall.</line>
                  <line>Father would pray: And before he would he would</line>
                  <line>leave. he would talk to me telling to stay close to</line>
                  <line>her. many of the white family would drive up in</line>
                  <line>carrages bringing somthing for her. They were</line>
                  <line>so genorous in every way. So one morning</line>
                  <line>Farther ask me would I like to go home with him.</line>
                  <line>I went he only lived a block from us. This was</line>
                  <line>the first time I had gone to any one s home. We</line>
                  <line>went in. He had three children Elexandra. Annie</line>
                  <line>Edward. his wife whom we called mother. She often</line>
                  <line>taught neighborn children like a kindergarten:</line>
                  <line>So almost every day except Sunday. I would go.</line>
                  <line>with father home to play with the children at</line>
                  <line>recess. Sometimes stayed all night because I was</line>
                  <line>in the way. at home: and Mother Gerry was just</line>
                  <line>about the sweetest lady I ever knew: She was so.</line>
                  <line>kind. I did not attend Class althoug She explain</line>
                  <line>any thing I ask her and treated me like other</line>
                  <line>children. This al so made me very happey.</line>
                  <line>Just here is the first time I had to learn something</line>
                  <line>about religions: I hadnt ever seen may mother</line>
                  <line>go to church nor my step farther. So one morning</line>
                  <line>before Farther Gerry came Mother ask me not to go</line>
                  <line>over to the Gerry home: That Elder Trouble</line>
                  <line>was coming. And I might be need. So when</line>
                  <line>He arrived with him was four women: They</line>
                  <line>came. I took my little out side to play. They sang</line>
                  <line>and prayed for many hours.</line>
               </surface>
           
 
               
               <surface>
                  <line>All at once there was a scream. Which I knew it</line>
                  <line>mothers voice. I rushed in the house. There my</line>
                  <line>mother was sitting up in bed. Clapping hands saying</line>
                  <line>Glory Hallalula. I been born again I rushed to her</line>
                  <line>as she said my son I am now happy. I didnt know</line>
                  <line>what it all ment. As I looked at all six people with tears</line>
                  <line>streaming down their faces. Mother held out her</line>
                  <line>hands saying bring my two sons to me. I turned</line>
                  <line>around to get my brother who was crawling in the</line>
                  <line>door. I carried him to the bed one of the sisters put him</line>
                  <line>in the bed and I climbed in. Mother as feble as she was</line>
                  <line>pulled us both against her breast and folded</line>
                  <line>back on her pillar say God bless them I can</line>
                  <line>now die happy. As she ran her feeble fingers through</line>
                  <line>the curls of my hair saying over and over. He</line>
                  <line>leadeth me through green pastures and lie me</line>
                  <line>down by still waters I will not fear to enter</line>
                  <line>the vally of death. I will not be alone. Soon she</line>
                  <line>was in a coma: I was going over to Father Gerry.</line>
                  <line>I was told that Mother had confessed religion.</line>
                  <line>When met Father Gerry I told him of this. </line>
                  <line>Father took me by hand and said lets go to her</line>
                  <line>at once. When we arrived every one of the colored</line>
                  <line>people had gone. No one was there except Mother and her</line>
                  <line>nurse. Father Gerry walked to her bedside. With</line>
                  <line>his left hand he stroke her brow softly. The word s</line>
                  <line>he spoke I cant remember. then he knelt by the bed</line>
                  <line>with me and the lady nurse. There he prayed and talked</line>
                  <line>with her. Mother spoke then, asking him what should</line>
                  <line>be done with Ely. I know I am going die. Eddie he has a father</line>
                  <line>to look after him. Ely as he is you know hasnt</line>
                  <line>any one. I now can die happy when I know that he will</line>
                  <line>be cared for. Farther then spoke saying Lena you know</line>
                  <line>that Bishop Gaylor is Elys Godfather and I am his</line>
                  <line>conselor. and Farther Eastern. He will be taken care of.</line>
                  <line>Who do you think he could live with Mother told</line>
                  <line>him to send for Matty Davis. Whom she had</line>
                  <line>lived with when she was a girl. Father waited</line>
                  <line>untill I went for her and came back.</line>
               </surface>
           
 
               
               <surface>
                  <line>There was agreed. That Matty Davis would raise me.</line>
                  <line>My mother was very happy. Father Gerray told Mother</line>
                  <line> Matty that she would have help if she needed it.</line>
                  <line>This was the begining of a new life for me: I left with</line>
                  <line>her. That was the last time I saw my mother alive.</line>
                  <line>She died the next day. My brother and his father moved</line>
                  <line>out of the corporation. To where most of the colored people</line>
                  <line>lived: soon he married again. My foster mother cooked</line>
                  <line>for Dr. Barton. They let her keep me on the estate. They</line>
                  <line>were very kind to me. I was then allowed to go almost</line>
                  <line>anywhere I wanted to go. I would go to Father Gerrays</line>
                  <line>house every day to play with the children. Mother Mat</line>
                  <line>had three children one girl two boys. Her childre were</line>
                  <line>grown: She owned a house where they lived. Neither</line>
                  <line>of them were married. I soon became to love her.</line>
                  <line>and daughters as if they were my own. When I was</line>
                  <line>eight years old. Mama Matty decided. I should go</line>
                  <line>to school. So we stop staying at night in the corporation</line>
                  <line>she would go home: School did not open as was expected.</line>
                  <line>So I would go to and frow. With her to work and</line>
                  <line>to play with the white children. I often would go to</line>
                  <line>building where my step father worked. To see him</line>
                  <line>I loved him. He loved me to I knew. He was so kind </line>
                  <line>everybody that knew him loved him white or black. He</line>
                  <line>was so strong I just loved to be close to him. He was</line>
                  <line>said to be the strongest man in the county. It was</line>
                  <line>often he would display his strenth by lifting. To</line>
                  <line>amuse the students who liked to watch him. His job</line>
                  <line>mostly was to wind the derick for the stone setters.</line>
                  <line>Just as I was turning nine. This was where things</line>
                  <line>began to change for me and happiness faded:</line>
                  <line>All this time my frienships had broadend. To where</line>
                  <line>almost every notable in town knew me many of</line>
                  <line>them would stop on the street and would talk to me.</line>
                  <line>I was taught by Mother to be curtious to every one</line>
                  <line>People liked me for this often told me that. I hadnt</line>
                  <line>ever thought any thing about race destinction.</line>
                  <line>I knew very little about colored children. The word Negro</line>
                  <line>was rarely ever used, or I just didnt pay any attention</line>
               </surface>
           
 
               
               <surface>
                  <line>I had the dream that some day I would be like the</line>
                  <line>students. I would be a cadet. All the white kids talked of</line>
                  <line>this we drilled and played to gather happily I didnt</line>
                  <line>only go to Father Gerrys house. I would go to any</line>
                  <line>ones house that had children. Have lunch. All these</line>
                  <line>mothers were kind to me. One morning I went to</line>
                  <line>Mother Gerrys to play. It was cold outside. There</line>
                  <line>wasn’t any children except her own around. Mother</line>
                  <line>said to us: The leaves has blown over the yard.</line>
                  <line>If you boys will rake them up. I will give fifteen</line>
                  <line>cents each. The job was soon done. When she paid us</line>
                  <line>out to the drug store we went. To buy an egg flip which was</line>
                  <line>a drink like a malted milk. Alexander, Edward and I.</line>
                  <line>We went to the dispencer. And ordered three drinks.</line>
                  <line>I had been here before many times with these children.</line>
                  <line>And got drinks even men and women had given</line>
                  <line>me drinks because I had no money. Dr. Conger the</line>
                  <line>propiator never said anything. This day there was</line>
                  <line>a new disspencer that I hadnt seen before. So he made</line>
                  <line>two drinks. Handed one to Alexander another one to</line>
                  <line>Edward. Didnt make any for me. I ask where was</line>
                  <line>my drink. He said You don’t get any: Alexander</line>
                  <line>spoke up why don’t Ely get a drink he has money to pay</line>
                  <line>for it. The dispencer said I don’t make drinks for no</line>
                  <line>nigger. He is a nigger. Alexander said he is one of us.</line>
                  <line>The fellow said I wouldnt make a drink for a nigger</line>
                  <line>if I never worked. The boys both tossed their glasses</line>
                  <line>over the counter and out of the store we went back</line>
                  <line>home. This was the first time I ever felt hurt except</line>
                  <line>when my mother died: We were just a block from</line>
                  <line>the Gerry home. We didnt talk at all on the way</line>
                  <line>home. Alexander was two years older than I. and</line>
                  <line>was older than Edward. I am not sure that Alexander</line>
                  <line>did not have more understanding about this than</line>
                  <line>we did. When we entered the house Alexander</line>
                  <line>and Sumner went strait to their room. I walked to</line>
                  <line>the libary where Mother Gerry and Annie was</line>
                  <line>the libary where Mother Gerry and Annie was</line>
                  <line>at me and said did you boys have a nice drink.</line>
               </surface>
        
               
               <surface>
                  <line>I said no I didnt have a drink the clerk wouldn’t make</line>
                  <line>me a drink. He called me a niggir and said he did</line>
                  <line>not make drinks for niggirs: Mother stop looking</line>
                  <line>at me and looked toward the fire. I stood there for</line>
                  <line>a moment. Then I ask her Mother what is a nigger.</line>
                  <line>She did not answer. She walked tothe hall and</line>
                  <line>called the two boys to come to the libiary they came</line>
                  <line>she said I have some cookies and will make some</line>
                  <line>hot cholate. You dont have to go to the drug store.</line>
                  <line>No one said anything. She went to the kitchen. I</line>
                  <line>followed her. While she was heating the milk.</line>
                  <line>I could see that she was a bit purturbed. Then I ask</line>
                  <line>her would she please tell me what is a nigger.</line>
                  <line>Why should I be called a nigger. It must be very</line>
                  <line>bad to be a nigger. She stood with her back to</line>
                  <line>me fully a minute. Before she spoke. She turned</line>
                  <line>and faced me. She said Ely I think this is a job</line>
                  <line>for Father: you go to him. He can explain this</line>
                  <line>better than I can. He is over at St. Agustus. For three years</line>
                  <line>I had been coming to her for understanding. This was</line>
                  <line>the first time she refused to explain to me. I did not</line>
                  <line>wait for choclate. I went over to St. Agustus Father</line>
                  <line>Gerry was in his study. He was writing.He looked</line>
                  <line>up and said Ely my boy what brings you here. I said </line>
                  <line>Father there is something I want to ask you if you </line>
                  <line>have time. He said Have a seat there. Ill talk to you in a</line>
                  <line>minute: I waited soon he said I am preparing this for class</line>
                  <line>and lecture this afternoon. Now what is it you</line>
                  <line>want to know: Ely. I stood up. Then I said Father</line>
                  <line>I want to know what is a nigger. I was called that</line>
                  <line>by the clerk over at the drugstore. He would not take my</line>
                  <line>money. Mother Gerry said I should come to you for</line>
                  <line>explanation. He started to say something and stopted,</line>
                  <line>just for a moment. Then he said Ely. I am very busy. I have</line>
                  <line>this lecture to do so I will send you to Father Eastern</line>
                  <line>tell him. I sent you and he will explain to you</line>
                  <line>what you need to know. If you dont find him</line>
                  <line>at home come back to morrow and I will</line>
                  <line>talk to you. I thanked him and left.</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>This was the first time I had visited. Father Eastern at home.</line>
                  <line>He often talked to me when he would meet me on the street.</line>
                  <line>He was very fond of children. He was older than any of</line>
                  <line>the fathers. He look after much of the charity program.</line>
                  <line>I did not feel as close to him as I did Father Gerry:</line>
                  <line>I wasnt sure that he would. Take time to talk to me.</line>
                  <line>like Father Gerry: I had to go five blocks to his house.</line>
                  <line>I went into the yard. There were many pigeons on the</line>
                  <line>lawn feeding on food he had thrown out to them. He called</line>
                  <line>to me saying. Ely my boy you come to see me. The way</line>
                  <line>he spoke so kindly. I lost my fear or doubt of him.</line>
                  <line>I was sure he would talk to me. He was standing in the</line>
                  <line>doorway. He said come in the house where it is warm.</line>
                  <line>He went in his library. Then he ask how my foster mother</line>
                  <line>was. I didnt care to talk as usually. Then I said father</line>
                  <line>I was sent here by father Gerry. For you to</line>
                  <line>tell me what a nigger is. and why should I have</line>
                  <line>to be called a nigger. He walked over to the window and</line>
                  <line>stood there looking out on the lawn. I spoke again saying</line>
                  <line>father have I done somthing wrong: He turned to me and</line>
                  <line>said I want to think a bit. No Ely you havent done any</line>
                  <line>wrong. Although I could see that he was awed a bit.</line>
                  <line>He still had his robe on. He had never been married.</line>
                  <line>He lived alone: He was a man in his sixtys. Several minutes </line>
                  <line>passed before he spoke again as he was laying his robe</line>
                  <line>over the back of a chair. He said Ely just you and I take</line>
                  <line>a walk down to the brook which was back of the</line>
                  <line>house. He put on his coat and hat. taken his cain and went</line>
                  <line>out to walk. He spoke about the birds enjoying their</line>
                  <line>food. We had walked a hundred yards he hadn’t spoke</line>
                  <line>a word. Then he started to talk of how beautiful</line>
                  <line>the autumn was: The trees were beautiful, He continoued to</line>
                  <line>talk of nature. By this time it seemed as if I was closer to</line>
                  <line>him than anyone else, Because no one of the white people</line>
                  <line>had ever talked to me this long at one time. All fear</line>
                  <line>had left me. I ask him again Farther are you going </line>
                  <line>to tell me what a nigger is: He said what happened.</line>
                  <line>to you. That you are so confused over the word.</line>
                  <line>I explained that I was called this name and was refused</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>to be sold a drink at the drugstore. The clerk served the</line>
                  <line>other children. And said he would not make a drink</line>
                  <line>for a nigger. Never. The other boys told him that I was</line>
                  <line>one of them he would not listen to them: He said a</line>
                  <line>nigger had no right to drink where white people drink.</line>
                  <line>Then Father said lets sit here on this rock. So we sat</line>
                  <line>down. He said Ely this has perturbed you very much. I know</line>
                  <line>I can see that and it may take some time for you</line>
                  <line>to understand the full meaning of this word. But first</line>
                  <line>I must correct that word nigger. The word is Negro.</line>
                  <line>Why it is trying for you is because you have been raised up</line>
                  <line>here within about ten blocks. Here in the corporation</line>
                  <line>you are treated like all other children you go to any</line>
                  <line>home where there are children and you are accepted.</line>
                  <line>Now dont let this burden you to much you will see</line>
                  <line>that it wont make any difference. To people that love you.</line>
                  <line>Then he said you must come and talk to me more</line>
                  <line>often: you know I am suposed to look after you I was</line>
                  <line>apointed by Bishop Gailor who is your god father as</line>
                  <line>one of your consellors. You can come to me any time.</line>
                  <line>I said to him father I still dont know what a nigger</line>
                  <line>really is. By this time we were back to the house.</line>
                  <line>He looked up at the sky then said You had better be going </line>
                  <line>to your Mama Mat. he called her. It is getting late</line>
                  <line>for you. Come back tomorrow after lunch and we will</line>
                  <line>talk again and forget about the clerk be cause he</line>
                  <line>should not have talked to you that way. I said</line>
                  <line>good bye and started to Dr. Bartons house where</line>
                  <line>my foster mother cooked: on the way home. I met many</line>
                  <line>white ladys that I knew every one spoke to me saying</line>
                  <line>hello Ely just as they had always done. Soon I was in the</line>
                  <line>kitchen with my mother she was ready to serve dinner.</line>
                  <line>She always fed me when she served the white people.</line>
                  <line>Because she rarely ever ate dinner on the job: It was</line>
                  <line>customary for the cooks to take what was left home</line>
                  <line>with them. So this is called pan totten. I didnt tell </line>
                  <line>day. She was not much for talking. She beleiving</line>
                  <line>in children being seen and not heard</line>
              </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>On the way home. My mother said to me Why are you</line>
                  <line>so quiet tonight. I had always been singing or jabbering</line>
                  <line>away or asking questions. Which she seldom answer.</line>
                  <line>When we got home. There was company. I went upstairs</line>
                  <line>to bed. I could not go to sleep. for a long time thinking</line>
                  <line>about me having to be a nigger. What could a nigger</line>
                  <line>be and why should God make a nigger. I knew there</line>
                  <line>were more to it than Farther Easton told me. I would</line>
                  <line>learn more tomorrow. When I go back to talk to Father.</line>
                  <line>The next morning it was raining and cold. Mama</line>
                  <line>Mat and I went to work. as usally. We were soaked by the</line>
                  <line>time we walked this half mile. I had to stay in the</line>
                  <line>house all that day sitting there watching my</line>
                  <line>mother make beaten biscuit at which she was</line>
                  <line>somewhat an artist beeting the dough with a</line>
                  <line>laundry iron. She let me beet some to. Helping</line>
                  <line>her gave my mind a lift: At two oclock was</line>
                  <line>her rest period. All the cooks was at liberty until</line>
                  <line>five oclock when they would go back to work to</line>
                  <line>prepare dinner. They would often visit one another.</line>
                  <line>This day several maids came to visit my mother.</line>
                  <line>There had been a lynching in Chattanooga. The</line>
                  <line>victim was a Negro by the name of Ed Johnson.</line>
                  <line>These maids were very much in destress over it. This</line>
                  <line>was the first time I had been around when</line>
                  <line>they were talking anything of racial. terms</line>
                  <line>this was the first time I had heard anyone</line>
                  <line>talk about how badly the negro. could be treated.</line>
                  <line>One of these maids I called Aunt Lula Gray. She</line>
                  <line>was telling them about how loyal. the negro</line>
                  <line>is to white. Even a Negro knocked down the</line>
                  <line>white man that shot and killed President</line>
                  <line>McKinerly: They conversed their whole period</line>
                  <line>of rest: I sat there listening to their conversation</line>
                  <line>and whims: That night Mama Mat and I</line>
                  <line>stayed on the estate. It was raining. The next</line>
                  <line>morning the sun came out bright. I could</line>
                  <line>go out to play with the children if I so wished</line>
                  <line>though I had decided I would not go back to</line>
               </surface>
                <surface>
                  <line>to Father Gerrys to play for a while or at all.</line>
                  <line>there was somthing that wasnt just right in</line>
                  <line>my feeling: The cochman. Was polishing the</line>
                  <line>carage when I heard the yells of the children</line>
                  <line>playing at Father Gerrys home: This was recess</line>
                  <line>soon I found I was on my way there. I had</line>
                  <line>almost forgoten about what had happened</line>
                  <line>previous at the drug store. When I reached his</line>
                  <line>home there were many children there playing</line>
                  <line>football I was one of the players on one side</line>
                  <line>of the teams and much favored before this day.</line>
                  <line>Just as I started to walk on the lawn some</line>
                  <line>kicked the ball it landed just in front of me</line>
                  <line>I picked it up intended to kick it. When a boy</line>
                  <line>name Randolph Shapper snatched the ball.</line>
                  <line>from me and said this ball belong to me</line>
                  <line>and I did not buy this ball for a nigger. to</line>
                  <line>kick: It seemed that every boy there turned</line>
                  <line>his back to me except Alexander. fathers oldest</line>
                  <line>son. He looked so unhappy. Soon they all</line>
                  <line>forgot I was there. To me I began to think</line>
                  <line>how things had changed in just two days</line>
                  <line>after this clerk had named me a nigger. I turned</line>
                  <line>and went back to where my mother worked:</line>
                  <line>I was hurt. Worse by this than ever before. all I</line>
                  <line>think of was how could God make a nigger</line>
                  <line>and why. Now I could cry a bit. I went strait</line>
                  <line>to the stable where Frank the cochman was clean</line>
                  <line>ing out the stables. I tried to talk to him</line>
                  <line>he only looked at me like all other Negros</line>
                  <line>would when I would ask what was a nigger.</line>
                  <line>It seemed to me there was an answer somewhere. I could not</line>
                  <line>give up trying: all at once I thought of Father</line>
                  <line>Eastern he had told me to come to him any time I</line>
                  <line>wish to talk to him. This is what I will do go to</line>
                  <line>him he was undestanding. When I arrived at his home</line>
                  <line>he was just returning from his walk after lunch.</line>
                  <line>We both met at his gate. He spoke to me so kindly</line>
                  <line>and invited me in the house:</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>I followed him inside. He often hummed a bit. I sat on</line>
                  <line>the leather couch. He pulled off his coat hung them in the</line>
                  <line>closet. Then put on his robe. Over ten minutes passed he</line>
                  <line>was still humming very low: I sat there waiting for </line>
                  <line>him to say somthing: I waited a few minutes. Then I</line>
                  <line>spoke saying, Father please tell me why there should</line>
                  <line>be Negros. He was looking at some papers on his </line>
                  <line>desk: He drop the papers on the desk: and turned to me</line>
                  <line>and said. Are you still confused over that word. I answer</line>
                  <line>ed yes sir: He said. dont be. He spoke this like it was a </line>
                  <line>command. I stood up. Tried to talk. then I bursted out crying </line>
                  <line>asking him please tell me why our God would make any</line>
                  <line>body a nigger, when no one liked them. I had put my face </line>
                  <line>in my hands. Bending down on the couch crying </line>
                  <line>I felt his soft fat hands resting on my head. He was </line>
                  <line>saying somthing. The first I understand him to say was.</line>
                  <line>They are all God children. He sat down on the cough. </line>
                  <line>Still patting my head. He ask me to sit up. Then he</line>
                  <line>said Ely I didnt think this meant so much to you: you</line>
                  <line>are so young to feel like this: What has happened.</line>
                  <line>I tried to talk. I began to tell him about what happened when</line>
                  <line>I went to play with the children this morning: How</line>
                  <line>Randolph refused to let me kick</line>
                  <line>his foot ball and other boys did not want to play with</line>
                  <line>me. He called me a nigger: Father we have been playing</line>
                  <line>togather for two years. Since that clerk called me a</line>
                  <line>everyone else now thinks I am no good. What will I do:</line>
                  <line>I ask him why did people burn Negros like they do. HeI followed him inside. He often hummed a bit.</line>
                  <line>hung them in the closet. Then put on his robe. Over ten minutes passed he was still humming</line>
                  <line>very low: I sat there waiting for him to say somthing: I waited a few minutes. Then I spoke</line>

                  <line>who had burned anyone. I told him of what I had heard.</line>
                  <line>the maids talking yesterday about the lynching in</line>
                  <line>Chattanooga. Then he said dont talk of this any more</line>
                  <line>dont burden yourself with things you hear like that</line>
                  <line>I have been much concerned about you since you</line>
                  <line>came to see me. Ely you are more advanced than</line>
                  <line>I had given you credit to be: This aproach caught me</line>
                  <line>much unaware the other day. So now I will explain</line>

                  <line>it is not at all bad to be called a Negro</line>

                  <line>He started to talk. by saying your race. Which is</line>
                  <line>called Negro, was brought to the United States from</line>
                  <line>Africa as slaves. To serve the econamy purpose</line>
                  <line>of the white people. They were given the name</line>
                  <line>Negro. Which repersents the word negroid of</line>
                  <line>Latin meaning black. They are the desendant of</line>
                  <line>a tribe in Africa named Negri on the Negri</line>
                  <line>river: This happened over a hundred years ago.</line>
                  <line>at that time. tyrant. law was legitimate almost around</line>
                  <line>the world: These men and women was sold at</line>
                  <line>auction just like anything of material would</line>
                  <line>be sold. For individual purpose or serve their cause.</line>
                  <line>Tyrant. Means ownership of man as property.</line>
                  <line>He said I was talking to your Grandfather</line>
                  <line>Ned. who is the scavenger for the city he was</line>
                  <line>doing some work here for me: yesterday. I had</line>
                  <line>quite a talk with him. He was born in slavery.</line>
                  <line>was sold on the block: Most of his family was</line>
                  <line>sold like he was. He said some of his people</line>
                  <line>has never been located yet. The Goverment freed </line>
                  <line>your people: by a revolution which was the so called</line>
                  <line>emancipation of the United State: The black</line>
                  <line>people maintained the name Negro. In the</line>
                  <line>Southern states mostly there is a discrimanation</line>
                  <line>that suports a segregation. Which is very much</line>
                  <line>a law: that suports this phraise. Anyone that</line>
                  <line>has negro blood in them is a negro: It dont</line>
                  <line>matter how white they are. They just dont</line>
                  <line>have the priviledges that the white race has</line>
                  <line>especiality in the South. These priviledges are</line>
                  <line>limited even in law: although it may seem</line>
                  <line>very unjust. The way our laws are exercised:</line>
                  <line>all of this supports our economy. Which means our</line>
                  <line>program of living. White people and colored. Love</line>
                  <line>each other all people serve each other because</line>
                  <line>we are all Gods people. Our religion teaches man</line>
                  <line>is born equal. Black people in the sight</line>
                  <line>of God are the same. Now do you feel better</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>Now I am going to make some sugestion for you that</line>
                  <line>I think will help you. First I want to say this. Dont</line>
                  <line>become bitter toward the white children because of</line>
                  <line>what has happened today. You know you are</line>
                  <line>liked by everybody here. You grew up among</line>
                  <line>the people here in just about ten blocks. Youre just</line>
                  <line>like any other child in Sewanee to most people.</line>
                  <line>This word Negro should have not come to you the</line>
                  <line>way it came. That is why it is so hard for you</line>
                  <line>to understand. I don’t think you have had any</line>
                  <line>association with colored children. So I think it</line>
                  <line>would be best if you would go out of the</line>
                  <line>corporation where they live and play with</line>
                  <line>them some. This I think will help you in many</line>
                  <line>ways. You will see they are very happy</line>
                  <line>and lovable people and there is nothing bad</line>
                  <line>about being a Negro. Then he said Is there any</line>
                  <line>thing you don’t understand now? If so ask me.</line>
                  <line>By this time I had stop crying and was listening</line>
                  <line>to every word he was saying although there</line>
                  <line>were many things going over in my mind </line>
                  <line>back to my mother by birth. Things she had</line>
                  <line>told me what she wanted me to be. As young</line>
                  <line>as I were it seemed to me a Negro was just</line>
                  <line>wortheless. What could he be Still a slave?</line>
                  <line>There was one thing on my mind I just could not</line>
                  <line>get off and that the military accadimey.</line>
                  <line>When Father ask me was there any questions</line>
                  <line>I spoke for the first time saying Father will I go</line>
                  <line>to the military accadimy when I grow up</line>
                  <line>He place his hand on my sholder and said No</line>
                  <line>Ely colored people dont go to school with white</line>
                  <line>people in the South. This to me was about the </line>
                  <line>hardest blow that could experience because this</line>
                  <line>was the greatest dream of all the boys I had</line>
                  <line>known. For four years this had been my</line>
                  <line>dream that some day I would be a cadet.</line>
                  <line>It seemed that everything of hope just floated</line>
                  <line>out me and I was just a shell.</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>Time had passed so fast I did not realized it.</line>
                  <line>Father said It is time for tea. It is five oclock.</line>
                  <line>had better be going before it is dark. He said</line>
                  <line>Now Ely you can come to me any time you</line>
                  <line>want to talk to me. Since you do understand</line>
                  <line>better now I want to see that smile on</line>
                  <line>your face again that has made every one</line>
                  <line>love you. Because you have been the</line>
                  <line>most happy little fellow I have known and</line>
                  <line>love everybody. Now your job is making</line>
                  <line>everybody love you. Now come to see me</line>
                  <line>more often. I picked my cap up off the floor</line>
                  <line>and walked to the door. Just then I realized that</line>
                  <line>I felt so close to Father. It seemed that he was</line>
                  <line>helping me so much in so many ways I had</line>
                  <line>found a friend differint than any one except</line>
                  <line>my mother by birth. I bade him goodbye and</line>
                  <line>started home. I had overstayed my time.</line>
                  <line>The streets were clear of everybody as always</line>
                  <line>was at dinner time. I ran most of this ten</line>
                  <line>blocks. When I got to Dr. Bartons my foster mother</line>
                  <line>was serving dinner. She gave me</line>
                  <line>a scolding and ask where had I been. I told her</line>
                  <line>to Farther Easterns house to talk to him. Then</line>
                  <line>she said If you dont stop annoying people</line>
                  <line>about being a Negro I will whip the life out</line>
                  <line>you. She said Frank had told her that</line>
                  <line>I had been crying around the stable that day and</line>
                  <line>asking him what was a nigger was. Stop asking</line>
                  <line>people questions especially like that and if I hear</line>
                  <line>of you doing it again I am going to whip you. We are</line>
                  <line>all nigger and there is nothing wrong about it.</line>
                  <line>Then it seemed everything was all anew again.</line>
                  <line>I refused to eat. Then I tried to tell her what had</line>
                  <line>happened that day. She didnt seem to care only said</line>
                  <line>she didnt want to hear about it. By this time I was</line>
                  <line>weeping. She was hurrying to get through with the</line>
                  <line>dishes. I was drying them when Mrs. Barton</line>
                  <line>came out and congratulated her on the dinner</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>She saw that I was crying. She was the most</line>
                  <line>kind lady. She aske me what was I crying</line>
                  <line>about. Mother spoke saying He is just about to</line>
                  <line>drive us crazey about him being Negro. He was</line>
                  <line>called nigger by a clerk at the drugstore a few</line>
                  <line>days ago and he thinks it is a desgrace to be</line>
                  <line>a Negro. He has been around you white people</line>
                  <line>all his life. For that reason he thinks he should</line>
                  <line>be white. Mrs. Barton smiled at my mother then</line>
                  <line>said Mattie dont be too harsh with him. Try</line>
                  <line>to bear with him. It could be more than what</line>
                  <line>you are thinking of. He dont know much about</line>
                  <line>colored people. That clerk shouldnt have spoke</line>
                  <line>as he did. Not at that time and to the children.</line>
                  <line>Give him time. He will work it out for him</line>
                  <line>self. She smiled and said good night. Then</line>
                  <line>Mother said We are going home tonight. So take</line>
                  <line>this pan of food to the room. I went out to</line>
                  <line>the servant room. Soon she came in.</line>
                  <line>While she was changing her clothes she ask me</line>
                  <line>did Father say to me. She seem to be different.</line>
                  <line>a bit. I was suprised to hear say Ely I love</line>
                  <line>you as my own. I suppose I just dont under</line>
                  <line>stand you. Things will be alright. Dont</line>
                  <line>worry about it. Then I told her that</line>
                  <line>Father said I should play with colored children some.</line>
                  <line>It would be better for me to know them. I ask</line>
                  <line>if I could stay home the next day and go to play</line>
                  <line>with the colored children. She said yes. We did not</line>
                  <line>talk on the way home. I went to bed early.</line>
                  <line>Mother told her daughter that I was to stay with her</line>
                  <line>tomorrow and could go to play with the children in the</line>
                  <line>Bottom. That was what they call the play ground.</line>
                  <line>The next morning my adopted sister talked with </line>
                  <line>me telling me how to get along with colored people.</line>
                  <line>Her father was a white man and how she was often</line>
                  <line>resented by colored people. We talked all morning.</line>
                  <line>most fond of her. She taught dancing to both white</line>
                  <line>and colored. She went to homes in neiboring towns</line>
               </surface>
        <surface>
           <line>At twelve oclock there came four white girls from</line>
           <line>the poor white side of town which was often called</line>
           <line>the sagers. That was what the arristocrats and</line>
           <line>colored called them. At their arrival she sent me</line>
           <line>to the playground. When I got there the kids were</line>
           <line>playing in groups. The larger boys were playing</line>
           <line>foot ball. I found that I was in a split groupe</line>
           <line>too young for one too old for the other. The fifteen</line>
           <line>year to twelve played football. They would not</line>
           <line>let me play with them. The others were around</line>
           <line>seven and eight. I am ten years old. I stood and</line>
           <line>looked at the big boys play for awhile hoping</line>
           <line>that I might be accepted in some way. When the</line>
           <line>ball was kicked out of bounds I ran it down</line>
           <line>and rushed back with it. One of them said Throw</line>
           <line>it here Clabber. He turned and said to the other</line>
           <line>boys Thats Clabber Wicks nephew. He will never</line>
           <line>have sense enough to play football and he thinks</line>
           <line>he is white. I walked away because I hadnt</line>
           <line>heard the word Clabber for three years not since</line>
           <line>I stop school. They all laughed. I walked away.</line>
           <line>Just across the playground was where the younger</line>
           <line>group around seven or eight year olds were playing.</line>
           <line>I stood watching them. They were playing a game</line>
           <line>I hadnt seen before the game called hop scotch. I had</line>
           <line>decided to join in with them. Up walk a big</line>
           <line>black woman with a bonnet on and snuff</line>
           <line>brush in her mouth. She spoke to two of the</line>
           <line>children telling them to come home. She stood</line>
           <line>staring at for two or three minutes. I spoke to</line>
           <line>her saying Howdy. She said You know you are</line>
           <line>sure a bastard if there ever was one. Just at</line>
           <line>that moment came up a young girl around eigh</line>
           <line>teen. Stopped by her side then said Who is</line>
           <line>that little boy? Hes a pretty boy. Then the big</line>
           <line>woman turned and said Did you ever see</line>
           <line>a bastard that wasnt good looking? They</line>
           <line>are love babys. But who wants one? They</line>
           <line>turned and walked away and all the children</line>
        </surface>

        <surface>
           <line>follow. I stood there looking as they walked away.</line>
           <line>There were three words that I just couldnt bear to be</line>
           <line>called bastard clabber nigger. I knew there was no need</line>
           <line>to talk to any one about it. Who cared This day was</line>
           <line>the first time I realized I was an orphan and thats all.</line>
           <line>Really no one really wanted me. Father had told me</line>
           <line>to love everybody. This I would try to do. I found</line>
           <line>myself wishing that God hadnt taken my mother.</line>
           <line>This last year I had wished much for her. As I was</line>
           <line>walking back home I met my grandfather driving</line>
           <line>his slop wagon on his way home. He lived a half</line>
           <line>mile out in the forest where he had a hog ranch.</line>
           <line>These three barrels was full of swill that he colected</line>
           <line>every day from the boarding houses to feed the hogs.</line>
           <line>I hadnt see him very much since my mother died.</line>
           <line>He stop to talk to me. Why was I not with Mother Mat?</line>
           <line>I told him Father Eastern had told me to play with</line>
           <line>the colored children. He nodded his head. I ask him</line>
           <line>could I go home with him for a while. He reached</line>
           <line>down caught my hand and pulled me up by him and</line>
           <line>said Now dont worry me with a lot of questions.</line>
           <line>He drove on. I sat there silent much disappointed</line>
           <line>because I ment to tell him some of what happened</line>
           <line>that day. I knew he didnt want to hear anything I</line>
           <line>had to say. The horses plodded along with the heavy</line>        
           <line>load into the woods. Once and he would mumble</line>
           <line>somthing to himself. Soon we reached the feeding</line>
           <line>pens where he would transfer the slop to other barrels.</line>
           <line>When this was done he gave a loud hoop hog call.</line>
           <line>Almost from nowhere hogs came running Chickens</line>
           <line>turkey all came. He poured the slop in the gutters.</line>
           <line>The pens were full of hogs all sizes. I spoke for the</line>
           <line>first time asking him how many hogs did he</line>
           <line>have. He didnt answer at once. He stood looking</line>
           <line>at them eat. I thought he had forgot my question</line>
           <line>which I would not ask again. He looked at me for</line>
           <line>a moment then said I dont know how many hogs</line>
           <line>I got. I just cant count them. I want you to</line>
           <line>count them for me. I was glad to hear him</line>
        </surface>

        <surface>
           <line>ask me. I leaped off the wagon climbed up on the</line>
           <line>board fence midway the pens and started counted.</line>
           <line>When I finished I looked around for him. He was</line>
           <line>down on his knees in a small pen holding some</line>
           <line>chicken intestines in his hand looking in the</line>
           <line>ground. I rushed over to the pen. He had a</line>
           <line>possum in a box fattening. I told him he had</line>
           <line>eighty seven head. He mumbled a bit shut the</line>
           <line>lid on the possum then stood looking at the</line>
           <line>hogs. I could see he was pleased. Then he ask</line>
           <line>me how close was that to a hundred. I told</line>
           <line>him fifteen. He just grunted several time as</line>
           <line>he drove to the barn about five hundred yaards</line>
           <line>away. He unhitched the horses. He seemed to be</line>
           <line>glad to have me along. He lived alone in a two</line>
           <line>room log cabin. He had this five acre farm</line>
           <line>under cultivation seven cows one bull. This was</line>
           <line>the first time I had been to his house in almost</line>
           <line>three years. He accumalated much since then.</line>
           <line>We went into the house. The fire place still had</line>
           <line>embers alive which he put on the coffee pot.</line>
           <line>He brought under his arm somthing wrapped I</line>
           <line>hadnt notice before until he opened it. It was</line>
           <line>some food from the Emma Tuckers boarding</line>
           <line>house. Miss Emma always gave any one of</line>
           <line>colored people food that was left. Grandpa</line>
           <line>was always there after the noon meal to pan tote what</line>
           <line>ever was left. This was it. Such food as</line>
           <line>Aunt Harriet could cook none such any</line>
           <line>wwhere. This cook was Sothern kno</line>
           <line>as Aunt Harriet Smith. There were often</line>
           <line>a turn away in the summer months</line>
           <line>at meal time. The food was soon hot in the pan</line>
           <line>candid sweet potatoes macarorni</line>
           <line>squash biscuits fried chicken cobler.</line>
           <line>I was hungry. Grandpa and I ate all of it.</line>
           <line>He remarked to what a wounderful woman</line>
           <line>Mrs. Tucker was. She was such a Christian and</line>
           <line>how she loved her servants and helped them</line>
        </surface>

        <surface>
           <line>every way she can. She asks about you every</line>
           <line>time she sees me. You must stop and see her</line>
           <line>sometime. You know she raised Lee your</line>
           <line>stepfather and George Price her headwaiter</line>
           <line>who has been with her twenty years.</line>
           <line>These Swanee people are the finest in the</line>
           <line>world. They have sure been good to me. At this</line>
           <line>I asked Grandpa hadnt I better be going? It will</line>
           <line>soon be dark. He said No wait until I milk</line>
           <line>the cows. I have to deliver milk to five</line>
           <line>places then I will drop you off at Mats</line>
           <line>house. I want you to do somthing befour you</line>
           <line>go. We were sitting on the floor in front of</line>
           <line>the fireplace eating off the hearth which he</line>
           <line>often like to do. He went to the kitchen got</line>
           <line>the milk buckets and came back set them</line>
           <line>by me then went to the corner of the bed room</line>
           <line>and pulled out a small trunk placed it in front</line>
           <line>of the fire place threw some light wood on the</line>
           <line>fire to make light then open the trunk lifted</line>
           <line>out some magazines. He said While I am</line>
           <line>milking. I want you to count the money in</line>
           <line>this trunk. It is all silver. I dont like bills.</line>
           <line>I will close the door. If any come shut the</line>
           <line>trunk and dont tell them of the money. and He</line>
           <line>went out. So I started to count. He finished</line>
           <line>milking came in. I was still counting. There was</line>
           <line>separating of smaller coins and I was slowed a bit.</line>
           <line>When he finished straining the milk and botteling</line>
           <line>I was too. He had nine hundred twenty</line>
           <line>eight dollars twenty cents all in silver.</line>
           <line>I told him the amount. He look at the money all</line>
           <line>in ten dollar stacks. He reached out his hand and</line>
           <line>patted me on the head saying Your mama said</line>
           <line>you would make a smart man someday. Now</line>
           <line>we know how much is there. Dont tell any body</line>
           <line>about it. Remember that nobody know. When I get money</line>
           <line>I always get silver and just put it in that trunk.</line>
           <line>I dont like banks and I dont want to be robbed</line>
        </surface>

        <surface>
           <line>He picked the trunk up and put it back in the corner</line>
           <line>of the room. It was dark now. The fire flames were</line>
           <line>flickering bright as we stood before the fireplace.</line>
           <line>This was the first time I had seen him a bit happy.</line>
           <line>I did ask one question; I remembered that father</line>
           <line>Eastern told me that when he ask Grandpa why</line>
           <line>he didnt spend some time with me he said I ask</line>
           <line>to many questions about things he didnt know</line>
           <line>the answers : and I was to much bother : He covered</line>
           <line>the the trunk with some rags and clothes then he</line>
           <line>had held out one book that he called his accounts.</line>
           <line>He knelt in front of the fireplace opening the book</line>
           <line> and began drawing milk bottles on the lines; when</line>
           <line>he finished drawing on four different pages; He</line>
           <line>said I keep my own books : You see this is the Barnwells</line>
           <line>the McCraddys. Tuckers. Johson : I deliver milk. every</line>
           <line>evening and morning. So I draw all bottles of milk</line>
           <line>for a week. then I colect ; When you come back</line>
           <line>again. I want you to help me check up on my</line>
           <line>customers I do privey work for. They all</line>
           <line>owe me money way back. I told him I would be</line>
           <line>back and would stay some knights. We came</line>
           <line>out of the house closed the door that didnt have</line>
           <line>a lock at all. We hitched up the horse to the sulky</line>
           <line>he used to deliver milk in : This was somthing new</line>
           <line>for me to learn for the last two week with colored</line>
           <line>people. Was to listen to what they had to say : </line>
           <line>and ask nothing &#x2234; as a child you were better liked.</line>

           <line>man to that’s why we are so white and look</line>
           <line>different. than other Negros. We have to take many</line>
           <line>insults. That’s why mama moved to Sewanee.</line>
           <line>from Winchester. Because it so hard for me</line>
           <line>there where I was born. I just hated to go to school.</line>
           <line>the children picked on me so. I was to have a fight</line>
           <line>every day. But dont fight any unless you have to:</line>
           <line>Try to love every body: as she was standing there.</line>
           <line>as beautiful as she was. No one would ever know</line>
           <line>that she was a negro: unless some one told you.</line>

           <line>time I had seen a woman. Stimulated by someone . .</line>
           <line>I really felt I was apart of them: I spoke saying:</line>
           <line>Ann. Jake is a negro. But he is not a bastard.</line>
           <line>is he. She looked at me for a second. The soft light</line>
           <line>from the fire place made her a glow her cheeks</line>
           <line>were flush her thin lips were so red. She put her</line>
           <line>arms around me and said my pretty boy no he is’nt then</line>

           <line>In come the serenaders: and began to play: This was my</line>
           <line>first lesson dancing: Soon there were several men.</line>
           <line>Had come to see Ann: She was most popular with men.</line>
           <line>She danced with all of them. Soon mama came:</line>
           <line>She wasnt in a good humor at all: she had business.</line>
           <line>to talk to Ann. Every body left: She said to Anne. I</line>
           <line>have a job for you. And you are going to take it.</line>

           <line>I put on my outing flannel gown. then knelt</line>

           <line>prayers. the went up stairs to bed: wondering why</line>
           <line>they did’nt like Jake. Hes a nigger and he isnt</line>
           <line>bastard. Remembering that father said all negros</line>
           <line>were same: No matter how black are how white.</line>
           <line>Early in my youth, I had become to admire</line>
           <line>strong physical men. Like my step father was.</line>
           <line>I was wishing that I was a strong big black man</line>
           <line>like him: Ann she loved him I do to: I thought</line>
           <line>of my plans that would be tomorrow: and how</line>
           <line>I would make all the children like me: I went</line>
           <line>to sleep: When I was awaken Ann was patting my</line>
           <line>cheek with her hand. Saying come to breakfast.</line>
           <line>are you going to sleep all day: We were alone: She said</line>
           <line>I will teach you how to ask the blessing. I told</line>
           <line>her I knew. She said bless the food. I said man that</line>
           <line>is born of a woman is in this world a few</line>
           <line>days and his heart is filled with trouble: When I</line>
           <line>looked up she was looking strait at me frowning.</line>
           <line>Then said where did you hear a blessing like that.</line>
           <line>I told he that was what grandpa Ned. said the</line>
           <line>other day when we started to eat. She said. uncle</line>
           <line>Ned gets every thing backward; They say that at burial</line>
           <line>I want you to listening Ely. to what I have say</line>
           <line>dont use the word bastard any more the word</line>
           <line>nigger either: It is not nice for children to use</line>
           <line>those words. When any one call you those words.</line>
           <line>Just don’t wish you were goodlooking. and she</line>
           <line>smiled: and kissed my forehead: Then she said</line>
           <line>Mrs Alton will be here soon: to interview me for a</line>
           <line>job: I helped her dry the dishes: For the first time:</line>
           <line>I ask her could I go to the store in the village; I</line>
           <line>wanted to buy some candy to give some to the</line>
           <line>children at the play ground. She said yes. That</line>
           <line>will be nice: Just the we heard some one calling</line>
           <line>at the front gate. I was the coachman asking was</line>
           <line>Annie home: We both went to the gat: Lady Alton</line>
           <line>and her husband go out. Started to talk to ann.</line>
        </surface>
    
        <surface>
           <line>saying  know we will like you. You are very</line>
           <line>pretty. Is this boy your brother? Ann said No Madam</line>
           <line>he is a boy Father Geurry ask her to raise. His name is </line>
           <line>Ely. The lady said Oh I know. He is Lenas boy. Ann</line>
           <line>told me to go and play not to stay too late. I went to</line>
           <line>the village to buy candy at John Ruefs store. I</line>
           <line>bought lemmon drops two pounds for fifty cents.</line>
           <line>Then back to the play ground. There were many</line>
           <line>children that I hadnt seen before. I walked up</line>
           <line>and set the bag down on the grass asking every</line>
           <line>body to have some candy. They stood and looked at</line>
           <line>each other for a few moments. Then I taken the bag</line>
           <line>and passed it to everyone. Some taken a handful. </line>
           <line>Some refused especially the ones that were there the few</line>
           <line>days before. All stop playing just stood looking at</line>
           <line>me. Then came up two larger boys on their way </line>
           <line>over to where the big boys played. One said What</line>
           <line>you got in that bag Clabber? They taken the candy and</line>
           <line>started away with it. I ran and snatched the</line>
           <line>bag throwing the candy all on the ground. Every</line>
           <line>body laughed. I turned and went home to Ann.</line>
           <line>When I came in the house I was crying.</line>
           <line>Ann ask me what was wrong. I said I dont want to talk.</line>
           <line>I went up the stairs to my bedroom. Soon Ann came</line>
           <line>up. I was lying across the bed sobbing. She spoke</line>
           <line>saying Whats wrong my pretty boy? I told her that </line>
           <line>she would not like to hear what happen. I am just</line>
           <line>a bastard and nobody of Negros like. Its just that</line>
           <line>way. She asked Did the children like the candy? I explained</line>
           <line>what happened. She said Get up. Put on your sailor </line>
           <line>suit that Maxwell Noll sent you. I will dress</line>
           <line>and we will go to the foot ball game with Georgie Teck. This</line>
           <line>game of the season. Lots of people are here to see </line>
           <line>this game. Now wont that be nice? You havent</line>
           <line>ever been to a game. So we go. She said If Sewanee</line>
           <line>varsity beats Georgie it will be a hot time in</line>
           <line>Sewanee tonight. We will stay uptown to see </line>
           <line>the cellerbration and the barnfire and come </line>
           <line>home with Mama when it is over</line>
        </surface>
       
        
               <surface>
                  <line>She helped me dress. While she was dressing. She</line>
                  <line>began telling me about the football team called</line>
                  <line>varsity: If they win this game and beat Vander</line>
                  <line>bilt on Thanksgiving. They would be the champs</line>
                  <line> of the South. We started to the place where they played</line>
                  <line>most of the colored people was going to: We had </line>
                  <line>lots of company along the road. Every body was </line>
                  <line>boosting for Sewanee. When we got there it look</line>
                  <line> like every body in Sewanee was there colored and</line>
                  <line>white. We didnt have to pay anything to go in</line>
                  <line>This was the way the program was to the colored</line>
                  <line>people. Every thing of sport are intertainment no</line>
                  <line>colored ever paid and Hospital, clinic, was all free.</line>
                  <line>Soon the the teams came on the fields there was</line>
                  <line>no grandstands. The playing field was roped off:</line>
                  <line>Every body stood and walked to and frow keeping up with</line>
                  <line>the play. Sewanee won twelve to six: It seem that the</line>
                  <line>people went wild: singing and yerling colored and</line>
                  <line>white. I was happy to think. Negros was some</line>
                  <line>part of white people: We went to Dr Bartons where our</line>
                  <line>Mama worked. And waited untill she finished her</line>
                  <line>work. By eight oclock the main street was full of</line>
                  <line>people colored white waiting for the school boys to</line>
                  <line>parade. They came. There were a pile of boxes and</line>
                  <line>rubish Two story high for the barn fire. It burned</line>
                  <line>while the students paraded around it and sang the</line>
                  <line>victory song. It was something to see. It was a</line>
                  <line>hot time in town that night: We went home there</line>
                  <line>were many colored going our way. They talking</line>
                  <line>of going to Nashville when the team went to play</line>
                  <line>Vanderbilt Unv. on Thank giving if they could</line>
                  <line>have enough money: This was the first time I had</line>
                  <line>heard colored people talking good about white people</line>
                  <line>Father Eastern was right. Colored people loved white</line>
                  <line>people. It was very dark many had lanterns. So</line>
                  <line>we could see how to follow the pathe through woods</line>
                  <line>there were no side walks in the town except on</line>
                  <line>the main streets on which poor people didnt live.</line>
              
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>Some of the young men with us stopt at our house</line>
                  <line>and had a glass of wine: I was soon sent to bed:</line>
                  <line>As I lie in bed thinking that I would never be like </line>
                  <line>the other negros. They would not let me be a</line>
                  <line>part of them. The children would never accept</line>
                  <line>me: To be a child of God. I will love every body.</line>
                  <line> I knew tomorrow I will have to go to Sunday</line>
                  <line>School. Would it be like the school day when</line>
                  <line>the boys called me Clabber: I knew I had to go:</line>
                  <line>This Sunday Mama Mat didnt have to go work so</line>
                  <line>we finished breakfast. I ask could I go to see the</line>
                  <line>cadets and and their band march. To church.</line>
                  <line>Mama said Yes: I did not care to be close</line>
                  <line>to the street they were on: like I use to do I just </line>
                  <line>stood about two blocks away and watch them </line>
                  <line>as they marched by: What a beautiful sight it</line>
                  <line>was. I said to my self it is really somthing to </line>
                  <line>be a white man. I looked on as the carrages</line>
                  <line>passed by men with high plug hats on. My</line>
                  <line>mothers words came back to me: When she</line>
                  <line>used to say I want you to be a fine man like</line>
                  <line>that man. At this day I day I decided I would</line>
                  <line>never be a nigger or Negro no matter my</line>
                  <line>grand father had said. He was glad he was</line>
                  <line>a nigger: Comparing him with these whit</line>
                  <line>men they so neatly dressed: and my grand</line>
                  <line>father so dirty and greasy and smell like</line>
                  <line>slop: I remembered: I was to go to Sunday School </line>
                  <line>This afternoon. so I started home. Thinking of my </line>
                  <line>farthers words niggers have to work day in</line>
                  <line>and day out always. Be your own boss. Then</line>
                  <line>you are somebody: That what I will do. I will </line>
                  <line>work: Then I thought of Sunday School. I hope </line>
                  <line>the children wont call me a bastard and Clabber</line>
                  <line>at church: As I was walking: along came a</line>
                  <line>boy four are five years older than I with a </line>
                  <line>shoe shine box: He had been to some of the boarding </line>
                  <line>houses shining shoes. I hadnt seen him before</line>
                  <line>this day. He was’nt playing with the other boys.</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>at the play ground: He spoke saying you are </line>
                  <line>the boy that Mrs Mattie Davis is raising. Your </line>
                  <line>name Ely. I said Yes: As I looked at him I thought</line>
                  <line>to my self he must be the blackest Negro in</line>
                  <line>Sewanee. But I wish I was like him. He talk</line>
                  <line>all of way home. He was different from</line>
                  <line>the other boys I had to pass his house before I</line>
                  <line>got to our house: When we got to his gate his</line>
                  <line>brother was waiting for him. They look like</line>
                  <line>the goldust twins. The older boy was name</line>
                  <line>Houston, the other was Simon. He ask me in to</line>
                  <line>have some ice cream. His mother sold cream</line>
                  <line>every Sunday to children. I went in Houston </line>
                  <line>told his  who I were: He told her that Father</line>
                  <line>Eastern was my conselman. Her name was</line>
                  <line>Sally Smith She was as black as she could</line>
                  <line>and as kind as she could be. She served me</line>
                  <line>a big saucer of cream. She looked so much like</line>
                  <line>the woman with the bonnet that call me a </line>
                  <line>bastard: I was afraid to talk to her at first:</line>
                  <line>I had finished my cream: I thanked her and </line>
                  <line>told her I must be going, that I had to go to</line>
                  <line>Sunday School this afternoon: Houston spoke</line>
                  <line>saying Simon and I will be going to we are </line>
                  <line>Episcopalian: We sing in the choir: Farther</line>
                  <line>Eastern will be there this evening and night: We </line>
                  <line>will stop for you: I thank them and went</line>
                  <line>home: I was so happy to think of some Negros</line>
                  <line>like me: I ran  rest of the way home into the</line>
                  <line>house telling Mama about these wonderful</line>
                  <line>people. This seemingly was the first time for </line>
                  <line>quit a while. I had said any thing that pleased </line>
                  <line>my Mama. I ask her could I go with them </line>
                  <line>to Sunday School. She said Yes, that these were </line>
                  <line>the finest boys in Sewanee and family. This </line>
                  <line>was the beggining of a life long friend ship:</line>
                  <line>Soon they came for me. They were so curtous pulling off</line>
                  <line>their hats and bowing to my Mama as she smiled which</line>
                  <line>she didnt do too often. They assured her they would</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>take care of me: I tagged along behind them untill </line>
                  <line>we got to the church. Farther Eastern and father</line>
                  <line>Clabourne both and another Father who was a student</line>
                  <line>of theolighy were standing out in front of the</line>
                  <line>Chapel. When we came up, Father Claborne spoke</line>
                  <line>to us first. Then father Eastern said Houston I am</line>
                  <line>so glad to see you have Ely with you. I would</line>
                  <line>like you to lead him along. He is a fine boy </line>
                  <line>and do need a big brothers like you two.</line>
                  <line>Houston answered him I will. Then he and Simon</line>
                  <line>turned and went to the vestibule to put on the carter</line>
                  <line>and gown with the choir: There were many children</line>
                  <line>few grown ups were there: No one seemed to notice</line>
                  <line>me. which made me very happy: When it was</line>
                  <line>over: I waited untill the boys change their atire</line>
                  <line>then they came out with father Eastern and</line>
                  <line>the student farther. Instead of going to our</line>
                  <line>home. They walked home with father Eastern</line>
                  <line>which was much out of our way. When we reach</line>
                  <line>father house. He patted us on the shoulder and</line>
                  <line>said That was a nice visit boys will see you</line>
                  <line>tonight: we said good father. as he smiled and went</line>
                  <line>in his gate: As we walked away home we joined</line>
                  <line>hands I was between them. We sang as we walked.</line>
                  <line>When I got home. I was so happy to tell Ann.</line>
                  <line>and Mama how I enjoyed going to Sunday School</line>
                  <line>This we done for many months. I would go on</line>
                  <line>Sunday mornings to Mrs Sally Smiths an help</line>
                  <line>freeze the ice cream so she wold let me lick</line>
                  <line>the dasher: Monday morning Ann had to</line>
                  <line>go on her job. I had to go with Mama on her</line>
                  <line>job: This was the first time I had decided. I was</line>
                  <line>going to find some work. After breakfast I</line>
                  <line>went out on the street: Hoping to find som-</line>
                  <line>thing to do. The leaves had fallen in many</line>
                  <line>yards where they didnt have men help I</line>
                  <line>would ask if I could rake up the leaves.</line>
                  <line>I only looked for the small yards: Most of the</line>  
                  <line>homes were like estates so called now∴ Large </line> 
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>houses of ten to fifteen rooms. the grounds</line>
                  <line>were two to three acrres. Most of these homes roomed</line>
                  <line>students. The whole town is built that way:</line>
                  <line>The first job I got was at Mrs Marian Millers</line>
                  <line>boarding house.. The next was Miss Carey Johnson</line>
                  <line>home these were small yards I charged twenty</line>
                  <line>five cents each yard which taken me three days</line>
                  <line>to finished: These to ladys like me very much.</line>
                  <line>They would send me to the drugstore with notes</line>
                  <line>for what ever they wanted: Soon I could find</line>
                  <line>some body would give me somthing to do for</line>
                  <line>a dime: are quarter: This didnt last long because</line>
                  <line>the schools all closed on the fifteenth of December.</line>
                  <line>The vacation period was in the winter months</line>
                  <line>at that time: Over half of the aristocrats went</line>
                  <line>away for the winter. because it was bitter cold </line>
                  <line>on the mountains. Even most of the servants</line>
                  <line>went to towns in the low lands. All of my family</line>
                  <line>stayed at Sewanee. Except Ann. this new job </line>
                  <line>taken her away. She traveled with Lady Alton. </line>
                  <line>She went to Louisvill. New Orleans Nashvill Atlanta</line>
                  <line>Memphis. For three months Mama and I stayed</line>
                  <line>home. She quilted several quileted. I batted cotton</line>
                  <line>for the quilts.Day when it wasnt to cold I</line>
                  <line>would go to see Houston are my brother. I didnt</line>
                  <line>care about playing with children any more:</line>
                  <line>Houston and Simon never went to play with the</line>
                  <line>other boys they stayed at home. They studied</line>
                  <line>books They had a organ they played. They</line>
                  <line>were always busy. Mrs Sally taught them to</line>
                  <line>keep busy, so when I could be with them I was</line>
                  <line>learning somthing: like I was when I was</line>
                  <line>with Mother Geurry and her family: The town </line>
                  <line>was just dead for three months, School would</line>
                  <line>open March the fifteenth of March All of the colored people</line>
                  <line>that had gone would be back and white people to:</line>
                  <line>The only amusement for the colored was to play cards</line>
                  <line>a game named five up. Which was played with pardners.</line>
                  <line>They would go from house to house to play seems they</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>all injoyed it. Gambling was much forbiddin in</line>
                  <line>Sewanee: People didnt have much money: Wages was</line>
                  <line>low. The popular wage was for adults was ten dollars a month</line>
                  <line>no matter what you done. Your meal was given</line>
                  <line>That was somthing. No one ever went hungary in</line>
                  <line>Sewanee. The men. That done construction got one</line>
                  <line>dollar a day for ten hours. Which most of them lived</line>

                  <line>vacation period. They lived on credit untill school</line>
                  <line>open. Many of the white people that were still there</line>
                  <line>they drive around among the colored people. Asking </line>
                  <line>how they were doing. There was always a doctor</line>
                  <line>you could go to with out cost. Medicine could be</line>
                  <line>abained if you didnt have money you could charge</line>

                  <line>the Church. I was mostly for the Sunday school</line>
                  <line>attendent. No one carried presents. Every one went</line>
                  <line>to get presents. Which was toys clothes candy popcorn</line>
                  <line>many things that would supply your needs. This was the</line>
                  <line>first time I had seen a Xmas tree. I got so many presents</line>

                  <line>When my sister Ann returned from her job and</line>
                  <line>travel. She told of all things she had seen an how</line>
                  <line>wonderful Mrs. Alton had been to her. how she</line>
                  <line>had passed for white at times for better accomadatio</line>
                  <line>and how she had combed her hair with the</line>
                  <line>ladys comb and brush: and how white men that</line>
                  <line>did'nt know she was a Negro. Had flirted with her,</line>
                  <line>telling how she and her madam has laughed</line>
                  <line>about it. Her madam had told her she should</line>
                  <line>go north where her oppotunity would be greater.</line>
                  <line>She had an article she had won in New Orleans</line>
                  <line>where she won a waltz contest. She lost in</line>

                  <line>of them had sent for Ann to come and see them</line>
                  <line>They tried to talk her out of it. So Ann soon</line>
                  <line>would not talk to them at all. (This is where I </line>
                  <line>refuse to call names of people.) This went on for </line>
                  <line>Weeks: Mama was much unhappy about the way</line>

                  <line>boy s one six months the are one a half year old. She</line>
                  <line>never married again. To years later Ann was</line>
                  <line>born. She worked and raised her own She had to</line>      
                  <line>be a strong woman: later she raised my mother</line>
                  <line>and now she was raising me: That night I knew</line>
                  <line>she was all I could ever wish for as a mother.</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>The wedding taken place. In about two weeks: We</line>
                  <line>had some what a party. White people that had</line>
                  <line>protested many came in carrages, The brought</line>
                  <line>many presents what didnt bring things they</line>
                  <line>sent them almost every thing the couple could</line>
                  <line>use for house keeping: They were given their</line> 
                  <line>funiture dishes rugs cooking utinels much</line>
                  <line>was used. But still it was better than they were</line>
                  <line>able to buy: Mama moved things out of the</line>
                  <line>house so people could dance. The white people left</line> 
                  <line>as soon as the ceremony was over: The colored</line>
                  <line>people danced and parted all night This night</line>
                  <line>no one told me when to go to bed so I stay up with </line>
                  <line>the party. Ann and Jake they were such a handsom</line>       
                  <line>couple. There was string music. They left the next </line>
                  <line>morning on the six oclock train for Winchester</line>
                  <line>Tenn. ten miles away to spend a week honeymoon</line> 
                  <line>in the town he was raised: Returning the decided</line>
                  <line>to live with Mama Mat. We had a happy family</line>
                  <line>Soon the schools opened. Sewanee was back</line>
                  <line>out of hibirnatuon. Mama went back to work</line> 
                  <line>for Dr Barton. I stayed with Ann most of the</line>
                  <line>time by having Houston and his brother to</line>
                  <line>play with and Ann to I forgot about the</line>
                  <line>Acadamy boys. Nothing much changed for two</line>  
                  <line>years for me. I would see Farther Eastern at</line>
                  <line>Sunday School: The next year Ann gave birth</line>
                  <line>to al boy: A few weeks later our house burned.</line> 
                  <line>We lost almost every thing we had: All my</line>
                  <line>happiness faded out: We had to move across town</line>
                  <line>where there were no children at all: I am around</line>
                  <line>twelve years old: Houses was scarce. This</line> 
                  <line>was the only place we could get: Ms Weber a</line>
                  <line>white lady let us live in a house in the back</line>
                  <line>of her estate. We were given almost every thing</line>
                  <line>we had lost in the fire. This is the way white</line>  
                  <line>people treated the Negros then: Mama taken</line>
                  <line>rhematisem badly had to stop cooking. She and</line>
                  <line>Ann started doing hand laundry. This kept me</line> 
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>most busy. I had to look after her son and</line>
                  <line>carry from the well to wash with. I did'nt see</line>
                  <line>an children. Only an Sunday when I went to</line>
                  <line>Sunday School. They bought me a wagon so I</line>
                  <line>could deliver clothes in. Things changed for me.</line>
                  <line>I was not loved like I had been. Soon no one</line>
                  <line>ever thought of me only when they need me to</line>
                  <line>do somthing: I became to be stuborn. Then I was</line>
                  <line>whiped. almost for the least thing: Every thing</line>
                  <line>of the pass of unplesantness came back in my</line>
                  <line>mind: I started to resenting that I was a Negro.</line>
                  <line>again.I would alway know I was a bastard and</line>
                  <line>and orphan: I had been given a dog name Tepsey</line>
                  <line>This was the only friend I felt I had. I would</line>
                  <line>run away and go into the woods and stay</line>
                  <line>for hours, just I and my dog. So often I would</line>
                  <line>sit and tell him my troubles. It seemed he under</line>
                  <line>stood. Then return home to take my whiping:</line>
                  <line>This lasted almost two years: One morning a man</line>
                  <line>rode up to our gate an a sorrel hore. I called</line>
                  <line>Mama to the door. She yelled at Thomas What</line>
                  <line>are  doing here. H came in he hug Mama and</line>
                  <line>Ann. He said just rode over here from Bridge</line>
                  <line>port Alabama. To see you Mat. He told her he</line>
                  <line>would like her to come and keep house for him</line>
                  <line>I am your cousin. I am now all alone my girls</line>

                  <line>buisness: My livery stable is doing good. I</line>
                  <line>need some one to keep house for me. You</line>
                  <line>know how I will treat you. Just like I did</line>

                  <line>fried apples and butter milk buscuit: Uncle Tom sat for</line>
                  <line>a minute looking at the food: then said Mat you</line>

                  <line>of apple: I looked at Mama. I saw for the second time</line>
                  <line>a tear falling from her cheeks. Uncle Tom continued talk.</line>
                  <line>When she was silent: We all sat for a while. As if</line>
                  <line>thinging for the best: Mama finilly spoke asking</line>

                  <line>to Winchester tomorrow to see Grant. I will be there</line>
                  <line>one day then I will start back. To Bridge port: Then</line>

                  <line>is Ned Green grandson: Lena was his mother. I promised</line>
                  <line>her before she died that I would raise him so I will</line>

               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>thing for him. He has the same trouble by his</line>
                  <line>father being white Ann had in Winchester when</line>
                  <line>she was small. Thats why I came to you the last</line>
                  <line>time: Uncle Tom said bring him. I forgot to tell</line>

                  <line>father is Bishop Gailor. Mrs Dr Richison is</line>
                  <line>his god mother: His father is one of the high up</line>
                  <line>familys of the town: They promised to help me</line>

                  <line>Tom said Mat I wouldnt worry about that: White</line>
                  <line>people dont do any thing for their bastards that</line>
                  <line>is the same conditons with this boy I have with</line>

                  <line>He liked me so I just adopted him. His father</line>
                  <line>has never give him one dime: You know what</line>
                  <line>I think of white people. They are no good:</line>

                  <line>Can I take my dog with me. He put his hand</line>
                  <line>in his pocket and pulled out a dollar. and gave</line>
                  <line>it to me saying this is his fare to</line>
                  <line>Alabama. Then Uncle Tom said when will you</line>

                  <line>Texas: Ann was all alone: she and her small</line>
                  <line>son. Neither of her two brothers ever live with</line>
                  <line>her. So Mama Mat decided it would be better</line>
                  <line>to leave me for awhile and she go to Alabama alone</line>
                  <line>and send for me later, which she did: I would</line>
                  <line>go to her Xmas: which was five week from</line>
                  <line>now: I was back around the colored people I</line>
                  <line>had tried to be friends with three years ago:</line>
                  <line>We lived just two hundred yards from the play</line>
                  <line>grounds where the colored children played.</line>
                  <line>although I did'nt care to play: In fact I did not</line>
                  <line>have time to play: Ann was a fine laundry woman</line>
                  <line>She had all the work she do working from ten</line>
                  <line>to fifteen hours a day: Since Mama had left</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>my work had doubled. I had to clean house</line>
                  <line>wash dishes help with her son and do most of</line>
                  <line>the delivery. The only time I had any enjoyment</line>
                  <line>was on Sunday when I went to Sunday School.</line>
                  <line>No one had called me a bastard are Clabber.</line>
                  <line>at Sunday School. This was why I enjoyed it</line>
                  <line>so much. All the Father were so kind to me..</line>
                  <line>Ann become to be more like she use to be when I</line>
                  <line>first came to them: She often went with me</line>
                  <line>carrying the delivey: I found out she was</line>
                  <line>trying to make money to go to Texas. I wanted</line>
                  <line>to help all I could. One morning a man name</line>
                  <line>Mr Rosbourogh. Rode up to the gate on</line>
                  <line>his horse. And called for Ann. He had small</line>
                  <line>package of laundry: Asking would she do this</line>
                  <line>as a special  for his wife and have it back tomorrow</line>
                  <line>by noon. H said to Ann you know you and Mat</line>
                  <line>are the best wash women in this town: My</line>
                  <line>wife Sarah thinks so. I am sorry that you</line>
                  <line>people are going away to Texas. Jake I know</line>
                  <line>has already gone Mat has gone to Alabama. that</line>
                  <line>leaves you and Ely alone. Now dont let any</line>
                  <line>thing worry you: If you should need me just</line>
                  <line>let me know. And when Ely grows up I want</line>
                  <line>him to be my butler. Hes said good bye and rode</line>
                  <line>away. We stood watch his beatiful horse striding</line>
                  <line>down the road. Ann said to me. He is the most</line>
                  <line>handsome man in Sewanee. I have heard that</line>
                  <line>he is a Jew. I cant help what he is he sure is good to</line>
                  <line>colored people. Many of Anns friends came</line>
                  <line>by that after noon. So many were going to Nashville</line>
                  <line>to the Vanderbilt game of foot ball on Thankgiven</line>
                  <line>Almost every body in the town that could afford</line>
                  <line>it both colored and white all went to see this</line>
                  <line>game between Sewanee and Vanderbilt: Every</line>
                  <line>body felt they were apart of this coledge. It was</line>

                  <line>So dont put them under your arm dont lose</line>
                  <line>any time: going. They catch the after noon train:</line>
                  <line>This was Wedensday: I had to go a good mile from</line>
                  <line>where we lived in to the corporation, I had’nt seen</line>
                  <line>Mrs Rosbourogh for two years∴ She and her </line>
                  <line>husband both were a younger than most people</line>
                  <line>that kept a home in the corporation and she</line>
                  <line>was a beautiful woman. When I entered with</line>
                  <line>the laundry. She spoke so kindly -telling how</line>
                  <line>nice Ann was to do this odd job for her: She</line>
                  <line>gave me a half dollar as a tip, saying this is for</line>
                  <line>getting here early. And when you grow up you</line>
                  <line>will be my house man, and I will teach you</line>
                  <line>every thing in a training: I was very happy this</line>
                  <line>was the first time any one had ever given me a half</line>
                  <line>dollar as a tip. As I started back home. I stated before</line>
                  <line>how large the ground were where these people lived</line>
                  <line>Their yards sizes were from one acre to five. There</line>
                  <line>were few streets that was strait for more than</line>
                  <line>five block. The streets were like trails meandering</line>
                  <line>around the estates, so there were no objection of</line>
                  <line>tresspassing through estate. I started to cut down</line>
                  <line>my walking by going through yards. When I got</line>
                  <line>to Mrs Tuckers she had the biggist boarding</line>
                  <line>house in Sewanee. She was buying turkeys</line>
                  <line>that was already dressed.. From a peddler who</line>
                  <line>supply many of the homes with poultry and</line>
                  <line>dairy product. His name was Crownover.</line>
                  <line>I stop to look at the turkeys. I hadn't seen turkeys</line>
                  <line>sold dressed before∴ Mrs Tucker was figuring</line>
                  <line>the amount to write the check. As she turned to</line>
                  <line>go in the house she saw me. I pulled off my cap</line>
                  <line>and bowed to her. She said Ely you are sure growing</line>
                  <line>up. I heard you had gone to Alabama with Mat.</line>
                  <line>I explained that I was going later. Then I said</line>
                  <line>I have’nt seen turkeys sold like that. She said</line>
                  <line>Its good to buy them that way. Tommorow is</line>
                  <line>Thanksgiving Day. All of the students have gone</line>

                  <line>the house. The call to saying to dinner at one thirty</line>
                  <line>We will hear somthing of the game by then,</line>
                  <line>I thanked her and went on my home. I had to pass </line>
                  <line>Father Easterns house, I statred in for a minute to</line>
                  <line>tell him, about me, going to Alabama. He was</line>
                  <line>sitting by the window, facing the street. H</line>
                  <line>beconed me with his hand to come on in: I opened</line>
                  <line>the door and went in the study where he was</line>
                  <line>writing; I explained to him that I was going away</line>
                  <line>He said. I know that Mat talked to father</line>

                  <line>School two are three times a month: I ran most</line>
                  <line>of the way home. I knew I had lost a bit of time</line>
                  <line>Ann would be angry: When I got home I rushed</line>
                  <line>into the house. Ann wanted to know what kept</line>
                  <line>me so long. I gave her the dollar the lady gave</line>
                  <line>me for her. Ann was suprised to get a dollar for</line>
                  <line>just to bloused even if the collars and cuffs</line> 
                  <line>trimming was fluted: She for got all about</line>
                  <line>me being late. I told her that Miss Emma Tucker</line>
                  <line>told me to come to dinner tomorrow. Could I go</line>
                  <line>She smiled and said. Yes little Negro boy.</line>

               <surface>
                  <line>Ann continued talking, as she ironed, about Mrs </line>
                  <line>Emma Tucker being such a Christian lady. Always</line>
                  <line>treating colored people nice. and her three daughter</line>
                  <line>were the same way. She said. She was good to</line>
                  <line>Lena your mother when she was sick. often she</line>
                  <line>sent food to her. tasty food that she thought</line>
                  <line>she would enjoy: I love her so much. She</line>
                  <line>and many of these ladys helped me get nursing</line>
                  <line>jobs when I was a young girl. She is just sweet.</line>

                  <line>I am depending on you: I was so happy to think</line>
                  <line>that I ment so much to her. I carried water and</line>
                  <line>and filled the two barrels by five oclock. Ann</line>
                  <line>said little boy when I finish ironing this peace</line>
                  <line>we will have to go to store and do some</line>
                  <line>shopping: you you need some clothes, I didnt</line>
                  <line>have but to pair of pants and they had been</line>
                  <line>patched so much. They were almost quilted:</line>
                  <line>We went to villidge to Mr Winns store. Her son</line>
                  <line>was large enough for me to carry him on my </line>
                  <line>back. We taken him along. She bought me a pair</line>
                  <line>of patent leather shoes a cap a pair of pants</line>
                  <line>with bows at the knees, which all cost four</line>
                  <line>dollars. I was now dressed up: I was so proud</line> 
                  <line>and happy: The next morning I helped her</line>
                  <line>with the dishes. When we were through I</line>
                  <line>dressed. And went on my way. I stopped at</line>
                  <line>Mrs Sally Smith house to see Houston</line>
                  <line>and Simon. I hadnt been to their house in two</line>
                  <line>years: They were much glad to see me. They</line>
                  <line>ask me to have dinner with them they were</line>
                 
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>having turkey: Mrs Sally siad we raise</line>
                  <line>our turkeys: There were many turkey in</line>
                  <line>the yard. This was why they could afford it</line>
                  <line>I told them: I was going to Mrs Tucker</line>
                  <line>for dinner: Mrs Sally, said I understand</line>
                  <line>Mrs Tucker wants to feed any body she can</line>
                  <line>I stayed a half hour and went on to Mrs</line>
                  <line>Tuckers. As I walked along thinking of</line>
                  <line>the Smiths. How they were different from</line>
                  <line>other colored people. We had never had turkey</line>
                  <line>at home: Grandpa raised turkeys he never</line>
                  <line>ate them he always sold them to the white</line>
                  <line>people. He was me were for ate lots of chickens,</line>
                  <line>but no turkey: When I arrived at Mrs Tuckers</line>
                  <line>I was to early it was twelve thirty the white was</line>
                  <line>eating. We would’nt eat untill they had finished</line>
                  <line>which would be one thirty. So Aunt Harriet told</line>
                  <line>me to the servant quarters and see Uncle Peter</line>
                  <line>her husband. He was very old, to old to do much</line>
                  <line>work. Mrs Tucker just let him stay around.</line>
                  <line>he had worked for her for many years. I went</line>
                  <line>in to his room. He was very hard of hearing:</line>
                  <line>When I told him who I was. H chuckeled a</line>
                  <line>bit and told me many stories of the past of</line>
                  <line>his life: H liked to talk about slavery. Which</line>
                  <line>I did like to hear.This one story I have</line>
                  <line>thought of so many times. How the Ku Kluck</line>
                  <line>Klan got started. He said many of the men</line>
                  <line>slaves would slip off and go to other plantations</line>
                  <line>to dance at corn shucking: The next day</line>
                  <line>they would be worn out, not fit for work:</line>
                  <line>So many of the masters had talked ghost</line> 
                  <line>story to the slaves to create fear in them,</line>
                  <line>so when they would find their slaves had</line>
                  <line>sliped off. The would wrap in white sheet</line>
                  <line>and way lay them comming home. Then</line>
                  <line>they chase after them which would almost</line>
                  <line>scare them to death. At first it was called</line>
                  <line>Patter Roll. It worked so well: on the slaves</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>that it was used on the carpet begger after</line>
                  <line>the war That was when they named them</line>
                  <line>selves K.K.K. It became to be and organization</line>
                  <line>that also created violence. He would talk a</line>
                  <line>little an have his laugh a while enjoying</line>
                  <line>his own story, one of the waitress came to</line>
                  <line>the door and told dinner was ready. He got</line>
                  <line>his cain and we came out to the kitchen.</line>
                  <line>Where aunt Harriett his wife who was the cook</line>

                  <line>I said No sir they say a fox is a dog grandpa</line>   
                  <line>and we are not to eat dogs: He put the lid</line>
                  <line>the pot: Bilt the fire up bright: Changed his clothes</line>
                  <line>telling me not to be asking questions during</line>   
                  <line>the spirital service: I told him I would not. Soon</line>
                  <line>the girls came: seven girls, three men. There was</line>
                  <line>not enough chairs some had to sit on the bed.</line>   
                  <line>I had to get on the bed back of them. grandpa</line>
                  <line>went into the kitchen and brought the table in</line>
                  <line>put it in the center of the room: He pulled the</line>   
                  <line>drawer half out. Then said the spirits would</line>
                  <line>go in this drawer when they came, not likely</line>
                  <line>before twelve oclock: We just sit and think</line> 
                  <line>of what we want our spirits to tell us.</line>
                  <line>If you dont beieve in spirits it will be hard</line>
                  <line>for me to get a message for you some times</line>   
                  <line>I fail not often: Dont be scared of sounds dont</line>
                  <line>talk only when I tell you to: We will be silent</line>
                  <line>for a while. Dont go to sleep you will get sleepy</line>   
                  <line>keep thinging of who you want to hear from.</line>
                  <line>The clock was striking eleven: He said We will</line>
                  <line>go into the spiritual world. No just sit quiet.</line> 
                  <line>for a while he sat down to the table puting his</line>
                  <line>hands flat on the table with the palm down</line>   
                  <line>There he sat every thing was so quiet, I layed back</line>
                  <line>on the pillar When I awaken the service was</line>        
                  <line>over. Every body was asking him what did</line>
                  <line>this mean he was telling them that what the</line>   
                  <line>spirits said. He did'nt know the thoughts: They</line>
                  <line>were standing looking at each other puzeled.</line>
                  <line>everdenty at what had happened: One of the</line> 
                  <line>me turned the table over looking as if he</line>
                  <line>thought it was a trick table: Then he righted it</line>   
                  <line>again, and said I thought the legs was going</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>to break, It sure did crack and move: I was</line>
                  <line>so disapointed that I went to sleep. I had</line>
                  <line>heard Mama Mat talk about him making</line>   
                  <line>the table walk: It was twelve thirty now</line>
                  <line>every one left I went with They would pass</line>
                  <line>our house. As we walked home, all they talked</line>   
                  <line>about was grandpa and what they were to</line>
                  <line>expect: I went in home, Ann was still up the</line>
                  <line>baby was not well. I started to tell about my</line>   
                  <line>experience at grandpas. She said I have seen it</line>
                  <line>he is good: I went to bed: The next morning</line>
                  <line>Ann was telling me to get up and go to the vilidge</line>   
                  <line>and get six bars of soap. This was wash day</line>
                  <line>When I got to the store I learned that Sewanee</line>
                  <line>had beat Vanderbilt: The eight thirty trian</line>   
                  <line>had arrived, The team was in a band wagon</line>
                  <line>The students were pulling it with a long rope</line>
                  <line>about a hundred of them every body was</line> 
                  <line>celerbrating. For weeks. The colored people that</line>
                  <line>went to Nashville that was the talk of how</line>
                  <line>Sewanee tronced the Comadores: Alday Friday</line>   
                  <line>and night Sewanee celerbrated: Black and</line>
                  <line>white: I was like the rest I loved every thing about</line>
                  <line>Sewanee: Even if I could not go to school like the</line>   
                  <line>white people: Saturday morning, I was taking some</line>
                  <line>laundry to Vanness house I met a lady and her son</line>
                  <line>name Gertrue Coaly. Her son was named Marland</line> 
                  <line>She was the cook here: While I was standing on the</line>
                  <line>pork waiting for the money This kind lady who</line>   
                  <line>was brown skin, short, a bit fat; she said You are Ely</line>
                  <line>arent you I said Yes slowly because I never</line>
                  <line>knew what to expect to be said me. I might</line>
                  <line>be called, bastard are Clabber: So I was always</line>
                  <line>on guard.. Not many people had kind things</line>   
                  <line>to say to me. She looked at for a moment</line>
                  <line>Then she said I have a boy: You may know</line>
                  <line>him his name is Marland: I knew your</line> 
                  <line>mother she had big plans for you too bad she</line>
                  <line>had to leave you. I have heard that you are</line>

                  <line>a smart boy: and a lot of helpe to your family</line>
                  <line>its to bad you dont have some one to send you</line>
                  <line>to school. It would be good if you could go to</line>   
                  <line>Winchester, where there is a good school. You have</line>
                  <line>a auntie there you know. They have a fine</line>
                  <line>school there taught by Dr Townsan. I am</line>   
                  <line>most proud of my boy. H will will grauate</line>
                  <line>at fifteen. He is going to be doctor. When he</line>
                  <line>grow up: I ask Where is your son. She smiled</line>   
                  <line>and said he is some problely talking with some</line>
                  <line>of the white students. They keep him with</line>
                  <line>them most of the time he enjoys being around</line>   
                  <line>them. They think he very smart and they have</line>
                  <line>a lot in common: One of the maids brought</line>
                  <line>me the money. I said good bye She said wait</line>   
                  <line>I will give a peace of cake. While waiting a boy came</line>
                  <line>up the steps. He to me Hello. I knew I had seen</line>
                  <line>him be fore. He was the one I heard talking with</line> 
                  <line>at the confecuary stand he and about fifteen</line>
                  <line>S.M.A. cadets were discusing: He was talking</line>
                  <line>about some man I never heard of. H was talking</line>   
                  <line>saying that his work hadent been completed</line>
                  <line>acording to history, he  Arostotale, Socrates</line>
                  <line>Plato. I had walke away thinking thinking a</line>   
                  <line>man with such name had to be some body</line>
                  <line>only thing concerned me was how could they</line>
                  <line>have fun with a negro. I wondered if they</line> 
                  <line>called him a nigger. I didnt know who he was</line>
                  <line>untill she came to the porch with a piece of</line>   
                  <line>cake. She said this is my son. She kissed him on</line>
                  <line>the forehead asking him did he have a plesant</line>   
                  <line>day. He yes Mother. He called the name of some</line>
                  <line>students We have been out to Morgan Steep. They</line>   
                  <line>are preparing for their exams next week. They say</line>
                  <line>I am a lot of help to them. We will meet there tomorrow</line>
                  <line>and study and debate: He had a book in his</line> 
                  <line>hand which he said I must read this book to</line>
                  <line>night it is on English pholosphy: As I looked</line>   
                  <line>at her, I could see she was so proud of him her son</line>
              
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>I said good bye. Not thinking that this boy</line>
                  <line>would thirty years later become to</line>
                  <line>be close friends two thousands miles away in</line>   
                  <line>an other state California: where he became to be</line>
                  <line>one of our finest doctors: As I walked home I</line>
                  <line>could'nt help but think how a mother loves</line>   
                  <line>her own. She was so proud of him he is</line>
                  <line>educated. Whit people like Negros that are educated.</line>
                  <line>Could I become be that way. It is somthing to</line>   
                  <line>have people to like you: I wondered why he</line>
                  <line>never comes over in the bottom where the negro</line>
                  <line>live to play ball. I wondered if he was a bastard</line>   
                  <line>White people seem to like bastards but negros</line>
                  <line>dont. He is light-complected with course black</line>
                  <line>hair looks like and Indian. Perhaps he is.</line>   
                  <line>She his mother said she knew my mother.</line>
                  <line>I decided that after noon I was going to be </line>
                  <line>educated. Reguardless what grandpa had said</line> 
                  <line>it was'nt needed by a negros. I am in some</line>
                  <line>way going to be educated. I will do as father</line>
                  <line>Eastern had so many times told me I should</line>   
                  <line>go to school. This I must do. I dont how I will</line>
                  <line>do it: I will go to Winchester to this great man</line>
                  <line>dr Townsan: When I got home there was an</line>   
                  <line>other delivery ready Ann was waiting for me</line>
                  <line>She went with me. The wagon was loaded</line>
                  <line>with laundry we had five different houses to deliver.</line> 
                  <line>That was why she went: Also we had to pick up</line>
                  <line>laundry to bring back: All ladies were getting ready for</line>   
                  <line>the Commencment dances to be held at Frenzy Hall.</line>
                  <line>Slating at the Rosebourh home was our last</line>
                  <line>stop: Mrs Rosebourgh was delighted to have</line>
                  <line>Ann to come by her self. She told Ann, if she</line>
                  <line>needed any thing while her husband was away</line>   
                  <line>just let them know: saying We are your friend.</line>
                  <line>I loved this  for her kindness so much. We started</line>
                  <line>for home a half mile go.. Ann talk much about</line> 
                  <line>the fine white friends we had. Stating the</line>
                  <line>Rosebourughs was her choice. and the Colmores:</line>   
                
                 
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>As we started through the park a white man of the</line>
                  <line>sagger class are poor white trash so called</line>
                  <line>by the negros: and the aristocrats: walk up to</line>   
                  <line>and said Ann: you know you are just about</line>
                  <line>the prettiest colored woman I ever saw: you</line>
                  <line>are to white to be a Negro and married to one:</line>   
                  <line>Ann at first did not speak just walk past him</line>
                  <line>as I he was'nt there: He followed us trying to</line>
                  <line>persuade her to stop and talk to him: That he</line>   
                  <line>wanted to be a friend to her: I could tell that</line>
                  <line>Ann very angry: As approach the styles that</line>
                  <line>went over the corporation fence. He rushed by</line>   
                  <line>us and stood on the styles steps blocking our</line>
                  <line>passages: I climbed over the wire fence. Then</line>
                  <line>Ann handed the laundry over a bundle at a time</line>   
                  <line>then the tin wagon: I thought she going to climb</line>
                  <line>the fence after me: Instead, she pulled the hat</line>
                  <line>pin from he hat. She stood for a moment looking</line> 
                  <line>at the man: She almost screamed at him saying</line>
                  <line>Castleberry if you dont get out of my way I will</line>
                  <line>ram this hat pin through you then started</line>   
                  <line>towards him he cleared the styles: She walk</line>
                  <line>over he aside about ten feet from her. He said</line>
                  <line>I just wanted to be a friend to you: He went</line>   
                  <line>another diretion: I hadnt seen Ann so angry.</line>
                  <line>before. She said there is nothing as low as</line>
                  <line>poor white trash: Thats why they dont allow</line> 
                  <line>them to work in the corporation: they are</line>
                  <line>just as the rich people say they they dont</line>   
                  <line>allow them to even knock at the front door.</line>
                  <line>What ever they have to sell they have to g to</line>
                  <line>the back door. I dont blame them: By this</line>   
                  <line>time we in the colored settlement. We had to pass</line>
                  <line>through it: There was middle white white woman</line>
                  <line>with Mother hubbard style dress on like most of the</line>   
                  <line>mountain woman wore. With a coal oil can in</line>
                  <line>one hand a tin in the other. Ann said Ely you</line>
                  <line>see her I said yes. She said that is Aunt Liz she</line> 
                  <line>is selling whisky called moonshine fifteen</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>cents a drink only to Negros. She said She</line>
                  <line>is a kind old woman: but there isnt nothing</line>
                  <line>a sagger wont stoop low enough to do:</line>   
                  <line>It was almost dark when got home: five</line>
                  <line>fifteen: Ann started to cook dinner: I had to</line>
                  <line>break up kindling for starting the fire next</line>   
                  <line>morning: Some one called from the gate Ann</line>
                  <line>I rushed in the house to the kitchen told Ann</line>
                  <line>there was some at the gate calling her: I didint</line>   
                  <line>even look to see who it was: She went to</line>
                  <line>the door asking: what they wanted: Castel</line>
                  <line>berry said Ann. come here I just got to talk to</line>   
                  <line>you: Ann became furious be gan to swear.</line>
                  <line>I sat on the steps, She went and got the pistol</line>
                  <line>come back to the door. The said Casselberry</line>   
                  <line>if you dont leave me alone and leave my</line>
                  <line>gate I will shoot you. He retorted back thats</line>
                  <line>just what you will have to do no negros</line> 
                  <line>going to shoot no white man: and better</line>
                  <line>not: At that moment she shot. I saw the</line>
                  <line>fellow whirl around, almost go to his knees</line>                 
                  <line>I ran up to Ann saying to her you hit him. I</line>
                  <line>knew she had never shot a gun before She trembling</line>
                  <line>holding the gun in her hand. We could hear him</line>   
                  <line>running toward the poor white town: Ann</line>
                  <line>then said I bet he wont trouble another negro</line>
                  <line>woman: Then she said this could cause trouble:</line> 
                  <line>I said I am going for help because I heard the</line>
                  <line>negros say you dont dare do any thing to</line>   
                  <line>white people: I thought of what Mr Rosborough</line>
                  <line>had said: If she ever need him just let him</line>  
                  <line>know: I broke away out of house going to Mr</line>
                  <line>Rosebourgh: I had to run a half mile which I was</line>
                  <line>going to do. As I entered the main street about</line>   
                  <line>half way to his house. I heard the sound of </line>
                  <line>galloping horse. To see was Mr Rosborough.</line>
                  <line>goind home from the store: I stood out in</line> 
                  <line>in road with my hands up he stop, I so</line>
                  <line>excited I couldnt hardly talk at first: When</line>   
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>I was able. To tell him what happened: He said</line>
                  <line>Did she kill him. I told him he ran away.</line>
                  <line>He was a fine strong man. He reached for</line>   
                  <line>my hand, with very little effort he swung me</line>
                  <line>up back of him: He said we will have to go</line>
                  <line>a mile around to the gates. I think. I had better</line>   
                  <line>go to  village. And stop any thing that might</line>
                  <line>be brewing: Then get to Ann later He turned</line>
                  <line>his horse around: headed for the poor white</line>   
                  <line>settelment in full gallop: When we reached the</line>
                  <line>the village. There was a gathering in front of the</line>
                  <line>big store. Casselberry was standing in the</line>   
                  <line>middle of them with a bandage around his</line>
                  <line>head. We road up to them: Mr Rosborough said</line>
                  <line>to Casselberry. How bad are you hurt. He said not</line>   
                  <line>to bad. I am lucky: That nigge buck Jake shot</line>
                  <line>me for nothing: and other one said the bullet</line>
                  <line>just grazed him. left a scalping job. It only</line> 
                  <line>stunned him: We are going to teach that nigger</line>
                  <line>a lessen: No nigger is going to shoot a white</line>
                  <line>man in Tenn. and get away with it you</line>   
                  <line>aristicrats pet the nigger: They are so high</line>
                  <line>collarded that they have to be put back in</line>
                  <line>their place: We will hang that nigger, to one</line>   
                  <line>of those trees. You know we are right: Mr.</line>
                  <line>Rosborough: sat quietly look strait at</line>
                  <line>Casselberry: This fellow that was talking so much.</line> 
                  <line>I had never seen him before: There was about</line>
                  <line>twenty men in the gathering: Mr Rosborough.</line>   
                  <line>Spoke with a voice of atthority, saying you</line>
                  <line>listen to what I have to say. I know and</line>
                  <line>you know that a Negro dont have any right</line>   
                  <line>of law in the South: Only where some white</line>
                  <line>people support him for justice: We people that</line>
                  <line>beleive in justice do protect them when they are</line>   
                  <line>in the right: Ann was in her own rights when</line>
                  <line>she shot you Casselberry: You have lied </line>
                  <line>about. it all. Jake her husband has been in</line> 
                  <line>Texas three weeks: Casselberry said It must</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>have been one of her brothers a nigger buck</line>
                  <line>shot me as I was passing their house: Mr</line>
                  <line>Roseborough spoke again, saying This is a lie Those</line>   
                  <line>two men are on ther jobs and wont off until eight</line>
                  <line>thirty: Now I am asking you to drop this from</line>
                  <line>your minds. There has never been any trouble</line>   
                  <line>between negros and white people here. These</line>
                  <line>negros that live here. They love Sewanee and</line>
                  <line>Sewanee people love them: I warn you if</line>   
                  <line>you start any trouble with them you have</line>
                  <line>to face the Military Accadamy bullets and</line>
                  <line>banets: And I and many of my coleagues</line>   
                  <line>will be on guard: He said to Casselberry You</line>
                  <line>should be ashame to tell that lie. She chased</line>
                  <line>you to day with a hat pen you are lucke that </line>   
                  <line>she didint kill you: He road away from them</line>
                  <line>in haste to our house. When we arrived the</line>
                  <line> was dark: He called from the Ann answered</line> 
                  <line>he dismounted we both went in: He talk to</line>
                  <line>Ann telling her that she would have plenty</line>
                  <line>of protection; that he would be back soon</line>   
                  <line>cover all windows with quilts so no one</line>
                  <line>could see any one from a distance. Then he</line>
                  <line>road away soon he was  with eight other</line>   
                  <line>horse men: They called Ann out to talk to</line>
                  <line>her telling her they would patroling the place</line>
                  <line>that night. Which they did. There was never</line> 
                  <line>any more about it. That is the real Sewanee</line>
                  <line>controled, back fifty years ago. The next week</line>                  
                  <line>was Commencement Week. The entertainments</line>
                  <line>were numerous: Dances colored people went to</line>
                  <line>see the styles that the ladys from other colledges</line>   
                  <line>wore and different dances. It was somthing to</line>
                  <line>see: I went with Ann one night: It was</line>
                  <line>very cold to stand outside and look in the windows</line> 
                  <line>Most people came in carrages. Some came</line>
                  <line>with oil burning lanterns. That was the only</line>   
                  <line>allumination there was in the town. When the</line>

                  <line>Hary Jahnson Mc Crady. She served almost</line>
                  <line>all of the lady in some way. This was the</line>
                  <line>first time I realized that something about me</line>
                  <line>that was not fair. That white people just let</line>
                  <line>a negro go so far. And no farther, although</line>
                  <line>we were apart of them and they were a part</line>
                  <line>of us. But why were we at a handcep: no answer:</line>
                  <line>I had worn the patence out of every body asking</line>
                  <line>quisteon&#x2234; The next week I left Sewanee for</line>

                  <line>man. I had’nt seen a negro that was a buisness</line>
                  <line>man. He must be great. I would learn to ride</line>
                  <line>horses. and go to school. When I came back</line>
                  <line>to Sewanee I will bee a man and wont have to take</line>
                  <line>any thing off no body. No one will call me a</line>
                  <line>basterd nor claber: When I arrived Uncle Tom</line>

                  <line>was living. Mama huged me and Tepsy She</line>
                  <line>was so glad to have us with her. I met the boy</line>

                  <line>nothing: uncle Tom had a nice house of six</line>
                  <line>rooms. He had four teams of mules to buggy</line>
                  <line>horses and buggys which he often rent to</line>
                  <line>drummers that want to go to Pittsburg five miles</line>
                  <line>away. The stable was a bit lapedated He had</line>
                  <line>three men on Payroll that hauled fright goods to</line>

                  <line>her. I was made ready I alway went to church</line>
                  <line>an sunday: I had’nt been to no other than the</line>
                  <line>Epsicapal church: This was Babtist where</line>
                  <line>aunt Becky was taking me. I had never</line>
                  <line>seen people shout the Hala lua way. We</line>
                  <line>went in church we sat very close up front</line>
                  <line>was a little early soon a long tall black man</line>
                  <line>with white hair: rose from his chair. and gave</line>
                  <line>out some words that the they sang each word</line>
                  <line>sounded like ten words in one: I could’nt take</line>
                  <line>no part in this singing: When it was finished</line>
                  <line>he read from the bible a verse then his text:</line>
                  <line>He talk for a few minutes very calm explaining</line>
                  <line>the scripture: and then all at once he let out a</line>
                  <line>yell. Saying who ever beleveth in me shall</line>
                  <line>have ever lasting life: at this all over the church</line>
                  <line>People were crying out amen. Thank god.</line>
                  <line>I looked about wondering what it is all about</line>
                  <line>Soom. Parson was moaning and groaning his</line>
                  <line>words out. He would stomp his foot an come</line>
                  <line>forward with another yell. by this time the</line>
                  <line>hand slapping and amens were so loud you</line>
                  <line>could’nt hear what Parson was really saying</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>at point a time He put his hand to the side and</line>
                  <line>yelled out who is going to be ready when</line>
                  <line>Gable blows the trumpet: Aunt Becky slanbed</line>
                  <line>her pocket book and hat into my lap. And</line>
                  <line>leapt to her feet with a scream. dashing by</line>
                  <line>me into the isle. Two more sister done the</line>
                  <line>same thing. I ran out of the church and went</line>
                  <line>down the road running. When I looked back</line>
                  <line>I saw three boys back of me I waited for</line>
                  <line>them to catch up. The ask me what was I</line>
                  <line>running away for: I told them I think my</line>
                  <line>auntie had gone crazy: I wanted to get</line>
                  <line>away from them. They told me that these</line>
                  <line>people was happy and was shouting come</line>
                  <line>on back and I would see so I went back I</line>
                  <line>would no go in the church: I waited out side</line>
                  <line>for Aunt Beckey to come out. When she did</line>
                  <line>She was acting like she did before she went</line>
                  <line>in so on the way home Aunt Beckey told</line>
                  <line>me that this was negro religion. The only</line>
                  <line>religion that that you felt the holy spirit moving</line>
                  <line>in your body: As she explained to me that</line>
                  <line>when holey spirit touches you: you cant be</line>
                  <line>still you just have to let every body know it.</line>
                  <line>She also said Episiceable s were not Christean</line>
                  <line>no white people were Christeans. They dont</line>
                  <line>know what the holly ghost is. you will have</line>
                  <line>to experence it for yourself. you can go with</line>
                  <line>me every time I go: When I got home I went</line>
                  <line>To mama mat. I wanted to know if the white</line>
                  <line>people at Sewanee was all lieing about them</line>
                  <line>being gods childrens: Aunt Beckey said no</line>
                  <line>white people were christians: Everybody laughed</line>
                  <line>at me to day: for running out of church. I did’nt</line>
                  <line>know that negros were the only people that reed</line>
                  <line>the Holly Ghost: I sure want this religion:</line>
                  <line>Here I started to asking uncle Tom about religion</line>
                  <line>he soon got tired of trying to answer them. Then</line>
                  <line>he said white people teach negros what they</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>want them to know: That will help them to be</line>
                  <line>more service to the white people: Thats why</line>
                  <line>most negros is willing for them to have all</line>
                  <line>this world&#x2234;just give them heaven. When you</line>
                  <line>are that way you are a good nigger a should</line>
                  <line>go to heaven. So dont ask any more about it:</line>
                  <line>I was detemined that if I had to a negro I want to</line>
                  <line>be as much like them as I could be I would go</line>
                  <line>to church and Sundschool. I would be touched</line>
                  <line>by the holly ghost. and shout like the others:</line>
                  <line>The next week I began to see more of the colored</line>
                  <line>people: meny men that was out of work</line>
                  <line>hung around the livery stable: Hoping there</line>
                  <line>would be some chance to do some work for</line>
                  <line>uncle Tom: This was the First time I had a crap</line>
                  <line>game. They would play cards and shoot craps</line>
                  <line>when uncle Tom was out. When They I would’nt</line>
                  <line>tell about it. Seems every body like me. I was</line>
                  <line>quiet happy. alhough I did have any time</line>
                  <line>to play with children: nor go to school. soon</line>
                  <line>uncle Tom started a junk yard. He taught me</line>
                  <line>to weight meterial. This I ran almost alone</line>
                  <line>for about six month. He after sent me with</line>
                  <line>the horse and buggy to bring back from Pittsburg</line>
                  <line>when a drumer rented it. There was one thing I</line>
                  <line>missed that was so different in the people there:</line>
                  <line>and the people at Sewanee was no one wore</line>
                  <line>a collar and tie: most colored all wore blue</line>
                  <line>over ralls The only ones that wore suits</line>
                  <line>were the Preacher school teacher and the</line>
                  <line>barber that ran it for white people: In Sewanee</line>
                  <line>every body except grandpa and Bill Smith were</line>
                  <line>man that lived in the carparetion: on the</line>
                  <line>street with a collar and tie: no students eiter</line>
                  <line>I had’nt seen a white man drunk. Until I came</line>
                  <line>here. there were coachmans. no colored men</line>
                  <line>driving carraiges where thier madams were</line>
                  <line>sitting by them: Their wasnt ladies carryng</line>
               </surface>
     
               <surface>
                  <line>.parasoils with ruffles. Iadies dressed in white</line>
                  <line>suits with their sherts waist with Fluted collars</line>
                  <line>and cuffs. This use to love to look at them</line>
                  <line>when they taken their evening walk: I always</line>
                  <line>liked to hear them say hello Ely when I tiped</line>
                  <line>cap: This I missed very much: For as the white</line>
                  <line>people here. They taken no part of the colored</line>
                  <line>people: no colored people ever said anything</line>
                  <line>good about white: They talked as if they</line>
                  <line>hated white people. I am having a struggle</line>
                  <line>with in. Try ing to get this negro religion worked</line>
                  <line>out and learning to hate white people. When I</line>
                  <line>had been taught. That we were all gods children</line>
                  <line>and we are to love every body: I didnt have</line>
                  <line>any bitter feeling toward any one here: I was</line>
                  <line>never call bastard by any. So I pray to be come</line>
                  <line>to a christian like the Negro. After months</line>
                  <line>going to prayer meeting church, hear the</line>
                  <line>confesing of converts telling of their experence</line>
                  <line>of being borned again how some white man</line>
                  <line>looked like Christ placed a small stone on</line>
                  <line>their tongue and the salvation went over them</line>
                  <line>and God told them. They had been borned</line>
                  <line>again: Then they would shout untill they</line>
                  <line>sometimes would pass out unconscous:</line>
                  <line>I prayed and prayed that I would become to be</line>
                  <line>like they were. I become to be so nervous that</line>
                  <line>I would have dreams that the world was coming</line>
                  <line>to and end. I would awaking screaming leaping</line>
                  <line>out of the bed. Would wake Mama Mat asking</line>
                  <line>did she hear gable blowing his trumpet: asking</line>
                  <line>what can I do. I am a sinner&#x2234; Mama sent me</line>
                  <line>talk to Revent Walker. whome was called</line>
                  <line>to guide you. So go to Parson. I did. He listen</line>
                  <line>to me then son keep praying the Holly</line>
                  <line>ghost is working on you It works in misterous</line>
                  <line>way s. So keep praying: I did just that:</line>
                  <line>This lasted over a year. I had not gone to</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>school as was promised: This was in the winter of 1906:</line>
                  <line>This. year Readie and I had worked hard. When coal</line>
                  <line>was sold at aptment houses. We had to carry. it in</line>
                  <line>scuddle s up two and three stories. Which it taken</line>
                  <line>all day: to carry a ton up and dump it in the bens.</line>
                  <line>This we had to do frenqently: I had still in my</line>
                  <line>mine to: go to Dr. Townsen school at Winchester: I started</line>
                  <line>to begging to let me go there and live with Aunt</line>
                  <line>Adline; and go to school: There were two brothers</line>
                  <line>by the name Pains: I like them very much:</line>
                  <line>Jonny Pain had just got married to a layg</line>
                  <line>name Annie Sick: All the men kided him saying</line>
                  <line>Pain is Sick: which he did not like to kid with</line>
                  <line>any: In a small cemetery in Bridge Port today</line>
                  <line>are two small tombstones: side by side the inscripiry</line>
                  <line>reads Pain and Sick. by Ripley, beleive it or not.</line>
                  <line>As spring came uncle Tom leased four hundred acre</line>
                  <line>for farm land: He hired men to cutivated it: He</line>
                  <line>gave me ten acre s and Readie the same: We could</line>
                  <line>have the money that it brought:. This increased</line>
                  <line>our task. We had to be up by three thirty every morn.</line>
                  <line>to feed ten head of miles. So they could leave by</line>
                  <line>six oclok. for the fields that was two miles away:</line>
                  <line>These men had a contract. at one dollar a day to</line>
                  <line>work. ten hours in the field working time and one</line>
                  <line>meal a day which was at midday: Which I had to</line>
                  <line>take to them. I work my crop in the afternoon. I had</line>
                  <line>good luck, I raised punkins and corn. I sold</line>
                  <line>for twenty dollars: This would help me go to</line>
                  <line>Winchester to school. The harvesting was over</line>
                  <line>in October: I went to carrying coal: and helping</line>
                  <line>the friight hauling: Anderson was one of the</line>
                  <line>teamester for uncle Tom. He was unloading</line>
                  <line>a barrell of sorgum molasses. It got out of control</line>
                  <line>and rolled against the curbin and bursted. The</line>
                  <line>store keeper who it was intended: Became angry</line>
                  <line>and started kicking Anderson. Anderson pick up</line>
                  <line>then end gate and struck the white man across</line>
                  <line>the head. The man fell on the side walk: Many</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>whit men came running to where this had</line>
                  <line>happened: Anderson ran toward the colored</line>
                  <line>part of town. The white was yelling Kill that</line>
                  <line>nigger. I was holding the team as usal. I drove</line>
                  <line>the team to the stable: Anderson had gone home</line>
                  <line>and got his gun. and had told other people</line>
                  <line>about what had happened. He left town. Soon</line>
                  <line>ten white men and two bloodhounds came</line>
                  <line>up to the stable. They were going after Anderson.</line>
                  <line>This was the first time. I had seen colored</line>
                  <line>people: So angry with white people. That they</line>
                  <line>cursed and swore at each other. Almost every</line>
                  <line>colored person had a gun: They did not catch</line>
                  <line>Anderson; When the law came back by with anderson</line>
                  <line>There was a rejoycing among the colored men: For</line>
                  <line>they sat around talking of how they hatted white</line>
                  <line>people: I listened, thinking: One fellow said I keep</line>
                  <line>my gun always handy. If I ever have trouble</line>
                  <line>with them: they may kill me: I bet Ill take some</line>
                  <line>with me when I go: I thought this was just about</line>
                  <line>the most sensible thing. I had heard any of them</line>
                  <line>say: This will be what I will do when I grow up:</line>
                  <line>buy a good gun and learn to use it. I began to</line>
                  <line>think that these s negro s are right: White people</line>
                  <line>are all evil and wrong they are not Christians</line>
                  <line>at all. I must be came to be converted in this</line>
                  <line>Negro relageon. I must. I hate white people</line>
                  <line>They are the cause of me being a bastard:</line>
                  <line>If I ever get back to father Eastern, I will tell</line>
                  <line>him how wrong his teaching is they dont</line>
                  <line>know anything about the Holly Ghost: I thought</line>
                  <line>then about my mother being converted when she was</line>
                  <line>near death: How the spirit had moved her: caused</line>
                  <line>her to be able to shout and clapp her hands, I prayed</line>
                  <line>and prayed that this mirical would happen to me:</line>
                  <line>I knew that in Winchester colored people were</line>
                  <line>like these here. I would soon be like them although</line>
                  <line>some people knew I am a bastard, But that wont</line>
                  <line>mean anything. When I am like all others negros</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>an a Christian like them and can shout. This</line>
                  <line>I kept in mine: Two later, I was told that I</line>
                  <line>could go to Winchester. Thanksgiving had just</line>
                  <line>passed. Uncle Tom gave me a wath lngesoil was</line>
                  <line>the make and a chain. Bought me a suit of clothes</line>
                  <line>This was the first time I had worn a new suit</line>
                  <line>of clothes: I had to leave my dog. I regretted</line>
                  <line>much.. as I went all alone: I got to Winchester</line>
                  <line>at two oclock that afternoon.. Ant Adline met</line>
                  <line>me at the train: She was a little hunch backed</line>
                  <line>lady: The kind that spoke vey few words at any</line>
                  <line>time a devouted Babtist. After asking how Mama</line>
                  <line>Mat was: There was no conversation: We walk</line>
                  <line>one half mile. Before reaching her home. She</line>
                  <line>showed me where I was to sleep. Then she taken</line>
                  <line>her scissors and ript open my pocket. That</line>
                  <line>Mama had sewed my money up in. There was</line>
                  <line>eighteen dollars. I liked her house only three rooms</line>
                  <line>She owned a organ: As we were about to have</line>
                  <line>dinner: we heard. shouts out in the streets:</line>
                  <line>We went out to see what was: Here was a young</line>
                  <line>girl about sixteen screaming. and shouting</line>

                  <line>fifteen people older than her. following her home,</line>
                  <line>Aunt Adline ran out and huged her saying</line>
                  <line>God bless her: I stood and looked on with</line>
                  <line>envy: Oh if I could only be like her to have</line>
                  <line>people loving me like that: and knowing that I</line>
                  <line>am a child of God: and could prove it: We</line>
                  <line>sat down to eat, I was very silent. I was thinking</line>
                  <line>when Aunt Adline said, That preacher and his</line>
                  <line>wife has converted a lot of people during this</line>
                  <line>betracted meeting it will be over tonight: I said</line>

                  <line>laughing about somthing, Although she was jovil</line>
                  <line>and pleasent kided me a bit about wanting to be</line>
                  <line>converted: When we went in the church the</line>

                  <line>My Mother and she was so close: The was</line>
                  <line>blowing the sleet against the pains. So cold</line>
                  <line>out side. This warmness of real friendship.</line>

                  <line>black boy: I knelt and kissed her han as it</line>
                  <line>rested on the arm of her wheelchair. She turned</line>
                  <line>her face to the window. As I said good bye .</line>
                  <line>This was the last time I saw either one alive.</line>
                  <line>When we got to the servant quarters. Auntie s</line>
                  <line>husband and grandpa. Was much pepped up</line>
                  <line>from their drinks grandpa was full o boast</line>
                  <line>He was very proud that he had a wife thirteen</line>
                  <line>years younger than his oldist daughter: I un</line>
                  <line>rolled the package: There was many thing s I</line>
                  <line>needed. Above all and overcoat, Which I had</line>
                  <line>never owned. This was a day I could never forget</line>
                  <line>We left for home the wind was high the sleet</line>
                  <line>had stopped: grandpa Didnt pay any attention</line>
                  <line>to the cold: I got very cold before we got</line>
                  <line>home: grandpa only mumbed to him self.</line>
                  <line>now and then: I thought he would fall of the</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>Wagon he would lean over so far an then straiten</line>
                  <line>up again: When we got home he drove the horse</line>
                  <line>under the shed. He dont unhitch him it wont</line>
                  <line>be long before I will have to take milk to four</line>
                  <line>people after we milk: When we went in the house</line>
                  <line>Ever Grandpa wife had dinner ready: What a</line>
                  <line>dinner backbones cabbage crackling corn bread.</line>
                  <line>Peach cobler. buttermilk, When we finished</line>
                  <line>we were almost founded: While we eating the</line>
                  <line>wind had lowered. It had started to snow:</line>
                  <line>By time we had finished milking the ground</line>
                  <line>was covired white: After meassuring the milk</line>
                  <line>grandpa. De cided he would use the sulky</line>
                  <line>to deliver the milk it would be lighter for</line>
                  <line>the horse to pull in the snow&#x2234; He drove</line>
                  <line>away. I went to the house. Wondering why</line>
                  <line>he wanted to take the jug of whiskey with</line>
                  <line>him. Ever, his wife, did have anything to say</line>
                  <line>to me for a while. I got busy carving a figure</line>
                  <line>four trigger for a bird trat. About two hours</line>
                  <line>passed. She stood looking out at the snow:</line>
                  <line>She said that old girl is sure picking geese</line>
                  <line>this evening: What a snow, she said Ely</line>
                  <line>I think your grand father is going on a</line>
                  <line>drunk. If he does you and I will have to</line>
                  <line>look after things for him. He does that about</line>
                  <line>every three months. It last about two day s</line>
                  <line>then he is alright for another three months:</line>
                  <line>She walked to the window. looked out. Saying. he</line>
                  <line>is back. I see the horse at the gate. We wated</line>
                  <line>for a half hour. No one came in. She said go</line>
                  <line>to the barn and see what is keeping him. I went</line>
                  <line>grandpa was nowhere to be found, I went</line>
                  <line>back and told her he was out there, I ask</line>
                  <line>did she thing he might have fallen off the</line>
                  <line>sulky. Then she said take the horse lead him</line>
                  <line>on the trail through the woods. If he fell off</line>
                  <line>he will be lying in road if he is hurt. I would</line>
                  <line>go with y ou. I cant leave the baby not for</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>long: I started through the woods the snow</line>
                  <line>was almost blinding. Though the trees on each</line>
                  <line>side of the trail guided well. Just as we reache</line>
                  <line>the brook I started. I do get in the sulky to</line>
                  <line>ride across the stream, The horse would not</line>
                  <line>move toward the stream: He just balked. I</line>
                  <line>got out to lead him again he refused to move</line>
                  <line>I started to walk to the stream. Then I stumbled</line>
                  <line>over grandpa covered in the snow: I rolled</line>
                  <line>him over: Brushed the snow off of him. He</line>
                  <line>was breathing. Although he out of undestanding</line>
                  <line>didnt say a word: He was limp as a rag: I</line>
                  <line>wondered what could I do to get him home I</line>
                  <line>couldnt lift him into the sulky. He will</line>
                  <line>freeze if he is left for long.</line>
                  <line>Then I thought about in Bridgeport uncle Tom</line>
                  <line>hauled all dead stock to the bone yard: When snow</line>
                  <line>was on the grown we would drag them any</line>
                  <line>thing would drag easy in snow as deep as this</line>
                  <line>is I turned the horse around and backed the</line>
                  <line>sulky over grand pa. I taken the reins off the horse</line>
                  <line>and tied grandpa to the axel of the sulky. It was</line>
                  <line>hard to raise he enough to get the reins under</line>
                  <line>him and around his body and under his shoulders</line>
                  <line>.I finally go him a stitting psition to tie him.</line>
                  <line>I led the horse up the trail home. Ever and I drug</line>
                  <line>him into the house. She made a Palet of a thick</line>
                  <line>comfort in front of the Place, and let him lie</line>
                  <line>there: Untill he sobered up: Ever was angry She</line>
                  <line>didnt talk at all; I made two figure four trap Triggers</line>
                  <line>To catch snow birds with. At one clock grandpa got</line>
                  <line>up and drank two dipper s of water. No one spoke</line>
                  <line>I went to the kitchen and went to bed. The next</line>
                  <line>morning. grandpa called to go and milk. This</line>
                  <line>was somthing I was getting tired of. My hands got</line>
                  <line>so cold: At breakfast: Ever told him how I went</line>
                  <line>and got out of the snow. And he should be ashame</line>
                  <line>to have to have his grandson bring him home</line>
                  <line>drunk&#x2234; She threatened to leave him if he ever</line>
               </surface>

               
               <surface>
                  <line>done this again; I left them quarreling. I went to</line>
                  <line>set some traps for birds:When I came back: As I</line>
                  <line>came in the door: I heard him say yes, I will</line>
                  <line>by you that churn, The one you can rock with</line>
                  <line>your foot: And is there any thing else you need</line>
                  <line>from town: Ever said no. She said I want</line>
                  <line>seventy five cents tommorow: That lady that</line>
                  <line>comes from Tulahomma: That straitns hair</line>
                  <line>will be here in Sewanee. I want to have my</line>
                  <line>hair straitened. And I want a dollar to buy</line>
                  <line>a paro comb twenty five cents for box of grease:</line>
                  <line>I Ely can stay with the baby while I am gone.</line>
                  <line>grandpa said his pet word got ding. Woman are</line>
                  <line>you trying to break me: He said when you lived</line>

                  <line>my friend: Every thing I wanted to do and</line>
                  <line>know was here for me. I was happier now</line>

                  <line>him scrape the hair off: And how white they</line>
                  <line>became: I just couldnt eat them they looked</line>
                  <line>to much like a cat: When he finished cleaning</line>
                  <line>the he put them in a flour sack: and bent</line>
                  <line>a sapling over and tied them on it and let</line>
                  <line>it go back up which he would let them stay</line>

                  <line>wife I am having a telephone put in I am the</line>
                  <line>only nigger in Sewanee that will have a</line>
                  <line>Phone the number is nineteen. So when the</line>

                  <line>to chopping up the herbs: I went to bed early</line>
                  <line>I was tired: I knew the next morning we</line>
                  <line>would saw wood and rack it outside of the</line>
                  <line>house for the next cold spell. Ever: grandpas</line>

                  <line>you get that one moulded in some butter:</line>
                  <line>You look at your self every fifteen minutes</line>
                  <line>since you got strait hair: I left them sitting</line>

                  <line>after we were had finished: He didnt stop untill</line>

                  <line>said, no I wont bring him: He is a Episcopalian</line>
                  <line>and a good boy. I dont have to use the rod on</line>
                  <line>him: Parson just grunted: And started to talk</line>
                  <line>about how hard times were and the Panic that</line>
                  <line>he was compelled to lean on the strong arm</line>
                  <line>of his brothers: Colections were low No one had</line>

                  <line>When we got the meat loaded. He went in the</line>
                  <line>house. Asking Sister Ever, Did she have any</line>

                     <line>good to you: I liked the little boy: She bought</line>
                     <line>a hammock, so we could swing under the trees</line>
                     <line>shade: I had a lot of fun there were many</line>
                     <line>children mostly girls. They sang a lot the</line>
                     <line>songs were School's day, Come be my Rain</line>
                     <line>bow. All afternoon we played. every day I</line>
                     <line>would take Sam on my back. to Play horse</line>
                     <line>with him: I would play galloping: He got a</line>
                     <line>kick out of it a hour of this he would be ready</line>
                     <line>to take his afternoon nap which he would sleep</line>
                     <line>in the hammock, while I would swing gently</line>

                     <line>A month later her husband, came I knew</line>
                     <line>he was coming. He came out with Sam and</line>

                     <line>mountain air. And you have helpt him a</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>lot. I was so glad to hear him say that. Then</line>
                     <line>he said, He likes niggers we have one name</line>
                     <line>Sambo at home the cooks boy. Sam is crazy</line>
                     <line>about him: There is nothing like a nigger</line>
                     <line>to care for a white child I bet on it: You all</line>
                     <line>go and play:I stood looking at him. He said</line>
                     <line>take him: I said: no I wont. At this moment</line>
                     <line>Mr Davis walked up. I said lady, pay me I</line>
                     <line>quit. She said Sam what is wrong. He said</line>
                     <line>much do you owe him. She a dollar tomorrow</line>
                     <line>his week will be up. She ask me why was I</line>
                     <line>quiting I told her that I was’nt a nigger</line>
                     <line>and I wont work for any body that called me</line>
                     <line>a nigger: She started to say somthing. He motioned</line>
                     <line>his hand. Then handed me a dollar then said I</line>
                     <line>have heard how high collard the nigger are</line>
                     <line>here in this town: I went out the back way,</line>
                     <line>not thinking what Mama will think</line>
                     <line>about it. When I got home, Mama and her son</line>
                     <line>and his were peeling peaches, sitting on the</line>
                     <line>porch. I was still angry. When she aske what</line>
                     <line>are you doing home this early, I told her I quit.</line>
                     <line>The man called me a nigger and I am not</line>
                     <line>going to work for any body that calls me that:</line>
                     <line>Mama said: You quit. I said Yes Mama.</line>
                     <line>She walked to the willow bush broke a switch off</line>
                     <line>and said you go back to them people and</line>
                     <line>ask them to take you back. I will tell you</line>
                     <line>when to quit a job. I thought you had got</line>
                     <line>all that nonsense out of your head:</line>
                     <line>I said Mama I just cant go back. She began</line>
                     <line>whipping me. I continoued say I cant, Mama</line>
                     <line>She stoped whipping for moment: She said</line>
                     <line>I am going to whip you untill you go back</line>
                     <line>to the job. I knew she meant what she said,</line>
                     <line>so I gave her the dollar they gave me: and</line>
                     <line>said alright Mama. Ill go back: She said,</line>
                     <line>and you do your job well, and forget</line>
                     <line>about being a nigger: As I walked away I</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>Felt the welts on my arms and legs that I</line>
                     <line>would rather die than speak to that white man</line>
                     <line>again:  I decided that I would leave Mama</line>
                     <line>and try to live with some bod else. I can take</line>
                     <line>care of my self. I am not a nigger to nobody.</line>
                     <line>If I was a bit larger, I would have shown</line>
                     <line>him how wrong it is to call people what</line>
                     <line>they are not: I went to my stepfathers house. He</line>
                     <line>hadnt come from work: Sarah his wife was home</line>
                     <line>I told her I wanted to live with them and why.</line>
                     <line>She said that, Father could not take me from Mama</line>
                     <line>Mat. I could wait untill he come and talk to him.</line>
                     <line>I wait for him. I talked with him, asking him</line>
                     <line>could I live with for awhile: We sat on the door</line>
                     <line>step of his house: I knew he loved me as much</line>
                     <line>as he did his own son. He didnt answer me for a</line>
                     <line>while. he sat looking at the ground. When spoke he</line>
                     <line>said You know to you are not my son. You were</line>
                     <line>given to Mat to raise that was your mothers wish.</line>
                     <line>We both loved her if she had lived things would</line>
                     <line>have been lots different: I dont like to see you having</line>
                     <line>such hard time: I know Mat is doing the best</line>
                     <line>she know. Try to stay with her. You have</line>
                     <line>been a boy hard to understand: I will go to Mat</line>
                     <line>and have a talk with her. You will soon be a</line>
                     <line>man. Then you can choose for your self: I ask</line>
                     <line>him did he think I should go to grandpa: He said</line>
                     <line>No. It wont be pleasent there Ned is having family</line>
                     <line>trouble. He and Ever are seperating: He is drinking</line>
                     <line>a lot: It is no place for you: I will go to see Mat as</line>
                     <line>soon as I eat my dinner: You go home: I had no</line>
                     <line>intension of going home not now away. I went</line>
                     <line>to the Play ground where the children played. I</line>
                     <line>hadnt stopped there in five years. My little brother</line>
                     <line>was playing with his pals. Having a good time</line>
                     <line>with all. He was eight years old. His skin was</line>
                     <line>dark he had a father: As I stood looking at him</line>
                     <line>I was pleased to think he is not an orphan not</line>
                     <line>a bastard: What a difference it makes when your are</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>both. The sun was still high. It was five oclock.</line>
                     <line>I wanted to be alone for a while. I started to go up</line>
                    <line>on the main street in the corporation. At this</line>
                     <line>time of day lots of the people taken walks. I</line>
                     <line>loved to watch them. Many of them spoke to me:</line>
                     <line>and I might find somthing to do to make money:</line>
                     <line>I was in my bare feet like all boys my age in the</line>
                     <line>summer months. There was a small stream feed</line>
                     <line>by the overflowing sisspools in the corporation</line>
                     <line>as I waded the there little children playing in</line>
                     <line>the sand. I stood looking at them. They didn't</line>
                     <line>no shovels no sand bucket no kind of tools like</line>
                     <line>the white children had to play with. I had</line>
                     <line>played in this stream when I was a small</line>
                     <line>boy daming it up making water wheels turn</line>
                     <line>as the water flowed over the dam. What fun it</line>
                     <line>was. These children dont have anything to play</line>
                     <line>with. Just their hands. My thoughts went back</line>
                     <line>to my job. Sam who  had been nursing had a</line>
                     <line>sand box rake shovel hoe three sand buckets wheel</line>
                     <line>barrow. His daddy called me a nigger. I will steal</line>
                     <line>these toys and give them to these poor kids. Thats</line>
                    <line> what I will do. I had to wait untill nine oclock</line>
                     <line>before it would be dark enough to slip in the yard</line>
                     <line>and not be seen. I had crawl a hundred yards to</line>
                     <line>reach the sand box and crawl back out. I take every</line>
                     <line>thing except the wheel barrow. I cut the hammock to</line>
                     <line>threads. I went back to my stepfathers house taken</line>
                     <line>the toys hiding them in the shrubery in the yard</line>
                     <line>Every body had gone to bed. I did not awake any</line>
                     <line>one I layed on the porch to rest. The I slept untill</line>
                     <line>morning. I heard Sarah beating the round steak.</line>
                     <line>I knew we were going to have chicken fried</line>
                     <line>steak and onion gravy for breakfast. I was so</line>
                     <line>hungry. I went into the kitchen. Sarah my step</line>
                     <line>fathers wife said Did you go home. I told her I had</line>
                     <line>slept on the porch all night. I ask where was Father</line>
                     <line>she said He has gone to the well to get fresh water and</line>
                     <line>take the milk and butter out of the well where we</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>put it to keep cool. You can go home now Lee went</line>
                     <line>to talk to Aunt Mat last night. I dont think she will</line>
                     <line>whip you this time. She handed me a bowl of bread</line>
                     <line>crumbs to feed the chickens which I quickly threw</line>
                     <line>to them. As Father came, he said What are doing</line>
                     <line>here so early. Sarah said he slept on the porch</line>
                     <line>last night. He said why did you do that</line>
                     <line>dont ever do that again. You go to Mat as</line>
                     <line>soon as you eat breakfast. And be a good boy:</line>
                     <line>Mat thinks she is right. She said you are</line>
                     <line>getting very hard to handle. She wants you</line>
                     <line>to know how to work. That people that dont</line>
                     <line>like to work will steal. And we dont want you</line>
                     <line>to be like that. I went home as I promised. Mama</line>
                     <line>was very angry with me. She didnt whip me. I</line>
                     <line>told her I woud find work enough to make seven</line>
                     <line>ty five cents a week, if I had time to look for</line>
                     <line>work. She said alright. That afternoon I taken the</line>
                     <line>toys I had stolen to the little colored children. When</line>
                     <line>I found them their were twice as many as there was</line>
                     <line>the day before. I didnt have enough at one each</line>
                     <line>to go half way around. Some of them began</line>
                     <line>to cry be cause I hadnt given them any. Now</line>
                     <line>I was sorry. I had brought any. I must do some</line>
                     <line>thing for the others. So I raided every play ground</line>
                     <line>in the corporation untill all the little children had</line>
                     <line>some toys. The idea came to me that white</line>
                     <line>people had everything they could afford to be</line>
                     <line>stollen from. And Negroes had nothing. I am</line>
                     <line>helping them. They will like me for it. I got a</line>
                     <line>job at Mrs. Emma Tuckers washing the pot</line>
                     <line>vessels for fifty cents a week. and my meals.</line>
                     <line>I would shine the boarders shoes five cents a shine</line>
                     <line>soon I was making a dollar and quarter a week</line>
                     <line>every body kept their shoes shined in Sewanee</line>
                     <line>at that time. I held this job untill school closed</line>
                     <line>for the winter. One of Mrs. Tuckers daughters was</line>
                     <line>married to a man name Elery Huntington</line>
                     <line>who was a professer in a colladge up north</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>came South for his vacation in the summer:</line>
                     <line>He became a victim of slow fever. That caused</line>
                     <line>him to be a bed patient for six month. He forgot</line>
                     <line>how to walk. Mrs. Susie Huntinton his wife</line>
                     <line>hired me after the students had left to stay</line>
                     <line>around to keep the coal supply in. I soon became</line>
                     <line>his nurse. I taught him to walk again. I was</line>
                     <line>the only one for a while that could persuade him</line>
                     <line>to take his medicine. and eat what his diet call</line>
                     <line>I would sit on the bed, and plead with him to</line>
                     <line>eat the mush. Mr. Huntington He was a</line>
                     <line>fine man. He liked me. When I would be pleading</line>
                     <line>with him to eat, he would say Ely you sure want</line>
                     <line>me to get well dont you he would take a mouth</line>
                     <line>full and hold it before he could swallow it as if</line>
                     <line>it was so repulsive. Sometimes tears would be</line>
                     <line>rolling down my cheeks by the time he finished.</line>
                     <line>He began to gain rapidly in January. 1909. this</line>
                     <line>was. One morning Dr. Hall, his Dr., called me and</line>
                     <line>Miss Susie his wife into the hall and said to her to</line>
                     <line>try to get him to walk. This was the hardest</line>
                     <line>task we had to do Mrs. Hunniton on one side</line>
                     <line>and I on the other. For two weeks it was a struggle</line>
                     <line>to get him in motion. Soon he gained his equilibrium</line>
                     <line>and was on his back to health. I massaged him</line>
                     <line>every day. This was the first lesson on being a</line>
                     <line>trainer and practical nurse. By spring he had gained</line>
                     <line>thirty five pound: In May he left for NewYork</line>
                     <line>and his family he had two sons Elery Jr. and</line>
                     <line>Fritz. I never saw him again. I was fifty three</line>
                     <line>years before I saw Mrs Susie Hunninton again.</line>
                     <line>I was so happy at this time. I had spent most</line>
                     <line>of my time helping Miss Susie with everything.</line>
                     <line>She was motherly in every way. There was</line>
                     <line>prayer every morning. I would pray for him.</line>
                     <line>I felt so close to them: I wanted to go with them</line>
                     <line>when they left. For six months no one hadv</line>
                     <line>mentioned nigger nor bastard at all. I had</line>
                     <line>about forgotten about it. The only time I saw</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>any colored people was Sunday after noon when</line>
                     <line>I went to Sunday. No one ever insulted any body</line>
                     <line>there. This year everything taken a big change</line>
                     <line>St. Agustus got a new presider by the name of</line>
                     <line>Tyson a minister from New York. Father</line>
                     <line>Gerry went in to South Carolina where he was</line>
                     <line>made Bishop. The schools changed from</line>
                     <line>summer season to winter like all other</line>
                     <line>colledges in the South. The medical school</line>
                     <line>was relinguished. Now there were just four training</line>
                     <line>classes theology civil ingernerring S.M.A.</line>
                     <line>We colored people had a good go: School all</line>
                     <line>winter. the tourists in summer. All table waiting</line>
                     <line>pressing cooking janitor work and most of</line>
                     <line>dray business was done by colored people.</line>
                     <line>A good laundress could make more money than</line>
                     <line>anybody. This is when I became to know how</line>
                     <line>the white people were interested in the progress</line>
                     <line>of their colored people. We had football teams</line>
                     <line>baseball teams. The coaches of varsity teams</line>
                     <line>would come and coach our teams. Any</line>
                     <line>colored coledge that would come to play with</line>
                     <line>us they would invite them. White people would</line>
                     <line>attend the games. We had two dance halls. All</line>
                     <line>coledge boys got the hotel work at Monteagle</line>
                     <line>another resort six miles away. Sewanee was</line>
                     <line>the jovial headquarters for them to come to.</line>
                     <line>To me at that time Sewanee was a little Rome</line>
                     <line>of the South, and everybody loved it. both</line>
                     <line>races. After the Huntingtons left, I helpt my mama</line>
                     <line>by delivering laundry. This year, I taken a vast</line>
                     <line>change from loving every body and trying</line>
                     <line>to love every body. because. I was struck harder</line>
                     <line>by insults and imposed on willfully more than ever</line>
                     <line>before: I am almost seventeen: although I am</line>
                     <line>a bit small to my age: One morning when</line>
                     <line>returning from delivery of laundry. a wagon</line>
                     <line>with too young boys driving it was going</line>
                     <line>my direction.: Most of these sagers that came</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>through the corporation were very good to the</line>
                     <line>colored people: because we often bought their</line>
                     <line>produce. I ask could I ride. One of them bowed</line>
                     <line>his head. I climbed in from the back just</line>
                     <line>as I straitined up I saw the larger one standing</line>
                     <line>with a hand ax in his hand drawn back to</line>
                     <line>throw. He said No nigger rides in my wagon</line>
                     <line>He threw the ax I could not dodge it. I It</line>
                     <line>struck me in the chest knocking me out of</line>
                     <line>of the wagon. Falling to the ground I was</line>
                     <line>Knocked unconscious. We were in front of the</line>
                     <line>Gregory home who ran the bank he</line>
                     <line>and Mr. Hodson. When came came to my</line>
                     <line>senses Mrs. Gregory and her son Winfred</line>
                     <line>had draged me out of the road to the side</line>
                     <line>walk. She was wiping my face with a</line>
                     <line>wet towel: She said You are Ely. I saw that</line>
                     <line>throw that ax at you knocking you out of</line>
                     <line>wagon. How cruel can any one be. We</line>
                     <line>pulled you to the walk. Can you walk. My</line>
                     <line>chest was hurting very bad. She said to Winfred</line>
                     <line>Help him go to Dr. Joe Seldons which was a</line>
                     <line>half block away. The Dr. said I had fractured</line>
                     <line>collar bone. When he finished with he said I</line>
                     <line>would have to wear this bandaging for too weeks.</line>
                     <line>I went home. I couldnt do any thing. I got</line>
                     <line>very bitter thinking how white people will</line>
                     <line>do a colored person. I am going to be like</line>
                     <line>the Negros in Alabama. Keep me a gun. This is</line>
                     <line>the last time that any white person will ever</line>
                     <line>harm me again. That I dont do it back. I will</line>
                     <line>get even with this sager some day if I have</line>
                     <line>to shoot him: When I got home. I told Mama</line>
                     <line>Mat about how it happen. I didnt tell her my</line>
                     <line>thoughts: of a revenge. This was time any one had</line>
                     <line>hurt me by a act of violence: Mama only said</line>
                     <line>Keep off other peoples wagon. You had no right</line>
                     <line>to ask for a ride from that you dont know:</line>
                     <line>They must be some sager from Tick bush. They they</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>are all mean, and dont like Negros. I am glad</line>
                     <line>the blade didnt strike. I carried the ax home with</line>
                     <line>me It was very sharp. I carried this ax in the</line>
                     <line>mountains with me for three years. For three weeks</line>
                     <line>I could only walk around. I went to the play ground</line>
                     <line>where the colored kids played: No one had any</line>
                     <line>thing to say to me. They acted as if I wasnt there:</line>
                     <line>The next day. I taken my dog and went to Morgan Steep</line>
                     <line>look-out: I went to the herb beds where grandpa had</line>
                     <line>show me every thing green and fragrant. I learned</line>
                     <line>to know what the leaves looked like. The gin</line>
                     <line>seng I soon reconized with its red flower in the fork</line>
                     <line>of the stalk like grandpa told me it would be. growing</line>
                     <line>in the shade of the muskadime vines. I sat at the water</line>
                     <line>falls for a long time: thinking for the first time</line>
                     <line>about life. What is to be done with life. Some people</line>
                     <line>have every thing, others dont have any thing and</line>
                     <line>have to be kicked around: it seemed. I thought of</line>
                     <line>everything I felt that was wrong that had been</line>
                     <line>do me. It seemed to me that every body of the Negros</line>
                     <line>and poor white people. wanted to hurt anybody they</line>
                     <line>could: This is why I am being treated like I am no</line>
                     <line>body cares for. me. The aristocrats have been good</line>
                     <line>to me be cause. They know they are the cause of me being</line>
                     <line>a bastard. My uncle and my grand mother dont</line>
                     <line>ever say anything to me: I must find something</line>
                     <line>to do that I dont have to bother them: It seemed</line>
                     <line>that every bitter thought I had ever had came back.</line>
                     <line>Tepsey my little fox terrier was looking me in my face</line>
                     <line>as if he under stood everything I was thinking. He</line>
                     <line>put his head in my lap, and Iayed there: I made up</line>
                     <line>my mind that this would be the last time I would ever</line>
                     <line>humble to anybody, and except hurt: I will fight</line>
                     <line>any body that do me wrong Negros and white</line>
                     <line>people. Father Eastern tells me love every body. This</line>
                     <line>would be alright if some body loved me. I began</line>
                     <line>to pray asking to be shown what to and how.</line>
                     <line>I layed back on the rock looking into the sky.</line>
                     <line>It was plesant awarm on this rock. When</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>awakened I was talking to my Mama. Lena, I thought</line>
                     <line>she was standing by me. And she was saying Be</line>
                     <line>brave my son Be patience Go up and look at the beauty</line>
                     <line>in Gods mountains: Tepsy was still lying with his</line>
                     <line>head in my lap. I knew it was a dream. I had to sit</line>
                     <line>and think it over for  while. It seemed so real that she</line>
                     <line>was there: We climbed to the top of Morgan Steep.</line>
                     <line>I remembered she said look at Gods mountains.</line>
                     <line>When  looked out over the caldron. I hadnt noticed</line>
                     <line>the laurel was in bloom. the whole ridge to the</line>
                     <line>right was crimson red. I stood there gazing at</line>
                     <line>how beautiful it was. There were magnolia trees</line>
                     <line>with huge white blossoms flickering in the sun</line>
                     <line>like the wings of a flock of white birds: I sat</line>
                     <line>down. To still look at this beautiful sight of the mountain</line>
                     <line>of God. The echo from cannon ball as it reported for</line>
                     <line>Cowan. Tenn floated up the canyon and added to this</line>
                     <line>enchantment. I could almost hear the mountains</line>
                     <line>say This is where you belong. I will take care of you.</line>
                     <line>I stayed there untill the sun set. It added more</line>
                     <line>beauty to the senery. Many people came walking</line>
                     <line>and in carriages. I did not even look to see who</line>
                     <line>they were. I had found the answer to what I wanted</line>
                     <line>to know. These mountains was my home. They belong</line>
                     <line>to God. I rose on and started home in soft twylight.</line>
                     <line>Something had happened that day. That I did not</line>
                     <line>try to tell any body about it. I lost all fear of everything.</line>
                     <line>I became more determined that I would have</line>
                     <line>what I wanted and that here was peace and happiness.</line>
                     <line>I am going to deal with the mountains as soon as</line>
                     <line>I can get me a rifle. I stop talking to every body</line>
                     <line>like I had been. When I got home Mama Mat ask where</line>
                     <line>had I been gone all day. I told her of the day and how</line>
                     <line>peaceful. Things had been, and that I had been</line>
                     <line>told that the mountains were my. home. She was</line>
                     <line>in an unusal good humor. She smiled and said</line>
                     <line>What will you think next. Then she said That</line>
                     <line>was the Martins boy that hit you with ax. Jack</line>
                     <line>Prince told me today. They are some of that</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>Tick Bush sagers Jack said come out to see him.</line>
                     <line>I said it alright, Mama. Ill get even with him if he</line>
                     <line>stays on these mountains: I am not going let no one</line>
                     <line>get by with nothing. Nobody: Niggers ore white</line>
                     <line>people. When they hurt me I am going to hurt back.</line>
                     <line>She said you shut up. You will get killed making</line>
                     <line>trouble with white people even if they are sagers.</line>
                     <line>I had started to the kitchen to go to bed. Why I felt so sure</line>
                     <line>of my self I dont know. I had never said anything</line>
                     <line>back contrary to her opinion before tonight. I stopped</line>
                     <line>in the door way: I said Mama, you can whip ore</line>
                     <line>kill meif you should want I wont raise my</line>
                     <line>hand against you. But no one had better not</line>
                     <line>put a hand on me to hurt me not even your</line>
                     <line>son will not whip me again. No one except you.</line>
                     <line>Mama ask whats come over you today who have</line>
                     <line>you been talking to I said No one except the mountains</line>
                     <line>and Mama Lena: I can see people will keep you on</line>
                     <line>your knees if you will stay there. I am not that blood</line>
                     <line>I guess. I am not a nigger. He had no law and is not even</line>
                     <line>a man. I am going to be a man. I am going take</line>
                     <line>care and protect you and everything I have. I see</line>
                     <line>I am going to live a lone most of the time: Mama</line>
                     <line>just stood looking at me when I said good night.</line>
                     <line>That night as I lay in bed I wasnt sleepy. I had slept</line>
                     <line>on the rocks a long while. I thought of my Mama Lena</line>
                     <line>how she linger with her sickness. That she was incurable.</line>
                     <line>I hope I dont have to die with consumption. I will do</line>
                     <line>as Dr. Seldon, what should I do to keep from</line>
                     <line>having it. Some people claimed it was hereditary.</line>
                     <line>I am small to my age. I must develope and be</line>
                     <line>strong. Dr. Joe will tell me how to do it. I hadnt</line>
                     <line>been advised by no one anything about spiritual aid, as I learn to</line>
                     <line>know in later years, although from this day</line>
                     <line>I never felt that I was alone anymore. All my</line>
                     <line>life I have felt not alone. Talking to the Dr. he</line>
                     <line>told me that consumption was not inherited.</line>
                     <line>It was contracted. Sleeping out doors was good.</line>
                     <line>Never sleep closed in plenty of fresh air you</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>should never have it. He showed me how to</line>
                     <line>take breathing exercises: and do atheletic</line>
                     <line>work: Dont smoke ciggeretts: When I left him</line>
                     <line>I stoped at Mr. Gregorys house to thank them</line>
                     <line>for aiding me when I was hurt:. As I approached</line>
                     <line>the front door Mrs. Gregory said come Ely. She</line>
                     <line>was a most kind lady. I explained, that stopped</line>
                     <line>to thank them for helping me: Winfred. and</line>
                     <line>Charlie had a glass of lemonade each Mrs.</line>
                     <line>Gregory said wont you have a glass? We sat</line>
                     <line>in the parlor and drank the lemonade. Mrs.</line>
                     <line>Gregory said Ely. I need some one to empty</line>
                     <line>the slop jars and fill the water pitchers</line>
                     <line>in my roomers rooms every evening. Would</line>
                     <line>you do this. I will pay twenty five cents a week.</line>
                     <line>I agreed to do it because it was close to home.</line>
                     <line>I could do it any time between two oclock and</line>
                     <line>six in the afternoon; I went to Jack Princes</line>
                     <line>house when I left the Gregorys house: I knew</line>
                     <line>I wanted to see Jack Prince more than any one</line>
                     <line>I knew: When I arrived at his house, he yelled</line>
                     <line>out Come little Ned. I went in the house. He said</line>
                     <line>I am going out to the barn. How is your shoulder?</line>
                     <line>Those Tick Bush sagars are a hell of a lot. Dont</line>
                     <line>ever have any part of them polecats: Boy, you</line>
                     <line>ought to go around old man Ned more often. He is</line>
                     <line>drinking him self to death. That young wife</line>
                     <line>is driving him crazy. I found him lying</line>
                     <line>on the ground drunk the other morning out</line>
                     <line>there in the woods with his privy wagon.</line>
                     <line>I did tell Mat. I know how you think of</line>
                     <line>him. He is a go old polecat: And thinks</line>
                     <line>a lot of you. So go and see him. He came</line>
                     <line>out. We walked toward the barn. He was</line>
                     <line>still talking about grandpa. A man drove</line>
                     <line>up name Dodson I knew he often sold</line>
                     <line>produce from the valley. He leaped off the wagon</line>
                     <line>snatched out a pistol drew on Jack saying</line>
                     <line>I got you this time. My heart almost choked</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>me. I didn’t know they were friends. I thought it was</line>
                     <line>the real thing. Jack said Where did you get it</line>
                     <line>Dodson. I bought it off a skunk for ten dollars.</line>
                     <line>He handed the gun to Jack saying Its one of the</line>
                     <line>latest. It is a Colt forty five. Jack said What balance.</line>
                     <line>He threw a tin can into the garden twenty steps</line>
                     <line>away. For six shots he kept the can bouncing.</line>
                     <line>dodson said to me He is the best the country</line>
                     <line>has got: Jack said to Dodson. This is my pupil.</line>
                     <line>He is going to be a mountain man. You ought</line>
                     <line>see him shoot a dam air gun. He dont miss</line>
                     <line>a dime twenty feet away. I only gave him one</line>
                     <line>lessen. That was how to squeeze the shot off he</line>
                     <line>hold a gun like his arms were made of stone:</line>
                     <line>He dont have any nerves. I am going to make him</line>
                     <line>the best rifle man. around here. Youl see.</line>
                     <line>Dodson said. If we have to stop a fued like</line>
                     <line>we had with. Tick Bush. bunch that time</line>
                     <line>we will need him: Jack said Dont mention</line>
                     <line>that. They laughed. Dodson got on his wagon</line>
                     <line>and drove away. Jack said to me dodson and</line>
                     <line>I have had some tough jobs rounding up the</line>
                     <line>moonshiners in in these mountains: I said</line>
                     <line>Mr. Prince, I want a rifle a good one a</line>
                     <line>Winchester. that is good for a hundred yards.</line>
                     <line>He said What the hell are you going to shoot</line>
                     <line>that far away: I said Thats what I want:</line>
                     <line>He said: You are not thinking of shooting</line>
                     <line>some body are you. I said If that has to</line>
                     <line>be done thats it. Jack said You stick close</line>
                     <line>to me Ill do your fighting: I know you are</line>
                     <line>bitter towards some people. But forget about</line>
                     <line>fighting: Henry his son drove up. He said</line>
                     <line>You are just who I want to see. How would</line>
                     <line>you like to work with me this winter I have leased</line>
                     <line>five hundred acres of crosstie cutting I have</line>
                     <line>a contract for three sets of switch ties and two</line>
                     <line>strait sets. I am to deliver them in March.</line>
                     <line>I will pay you fifty cents a day. We will</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>hue the ties where we cut the trees and</line>
                     <line>snake then out with the oxes. You can learn</line>
                     <line>to drive them then. When we dont want to</line>
                     <line>work we will hunt. I didnt answer him</line>
                     <line>at once. Jack said If you will help him</line>
                     <line>I will let you have a gun a Winchester</line>
                     <line>thirty two special. You will have to leave it</line>
                     <line>here. Only when you are going to hunt. You</line>
                     <line>cant shoot it around town It ranges to far.</line>
                     <line>I want eight dollars for it. You can pay fifty</line>
                     <line>cents a week. Its a good gun been trued to</line>
                     <line>the finest bead. In a few days you will be</line>
                     <line>picking the eyes out of the woodpeckers.</line>
                     <line>I told him I had to ask Mama. Jack said Mat</line>
                     <line>wont care. She know I will take care of you</line>
                     <line>at all times. As I passed the graveyard I</line>
                     <line>saw Cretcher and Henry Woods digging a</line>
                     <line>grave. These two colored men worked for.</line>
                     <line>the city. I knew some of the notables had died,</line>
                     <line>and there to be a big feunerual. I hadnt been up</line>
                     <line>town since I was hurt: I hadnt heard that</line>
                     <line>Mr. Du Bose had died untill I ask Henry Woods.</line>
                     <line>He told me who it was. I felt somewhat sick</line>
                     <line>for a few moments: He I had known from</line>
                     <line>the first day I was large enough to be on the</line>
                     <line>streets. He always spoke to me. When at a distance</line>
                     <line>he would motion his cain. at me like a salute.</line>
                     <line>I knew this would be a military funeral. I got</line>
                     <line>to see this. I had wait and hour. While I was</line>
                     <line>waiting. there came two white boys. I had seen</line>
                     <line>them on the streets: They did not go over in the</line>
                     <line>main streets where most of the other boys played.</line>
                    <line>I would only see them on Sunday at church.</line>
                     <line>when I went to see the cadets parade. I knew</line>
                     <line>they were of the notables that lived in the</line>
                     <line>corporation: They had been hunting: Each spoke</line>
                     <line>to me. One boy was seventeen the other was my</line>
                     <line>age. They told me their names were D.S. and</line>
                     <line>John McKay. D.S. was the oldest. He had a</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>twenty two caliber rifle. D.S. said: Lets go over</line>
                     <line>to back of the graveyard and target practice while</line>
                     <line>we wait for the prosession. We did. I told them</line>
                     <line>my intention of becoming a mountain man.</line>
                     <line>I told them all I had learned about the profit that</line>
                     <line>could be made if you just knew where to find</line>
                     <line>it such as herbs berrys nuts grapes. flowers</line>
                     <line>mineral water and game of all kind. I am</line>
                     <line>studying how to be a crack shot: Johny he was</line>
                     <line>most interested in my plans: They found a small</line>
                     <line>tin can, placed it against the rock wall. Each of</line>
                     <line>them taken turns shooting at it. Four shots each</line>
                     <line>no hits. D.S. ask me did I want to try. I said</line>
                     <line>yes. explaining that I hadnt shot a real gun</line>
                     <line>like this one. I only had a air gun. He handed</line>
                     <line>me the gun. I had to shoot with one hand. He</line>
                     <line>cocked the gun for me. I shot five times hitting</line>
                     <line>the can every shot. They were astounded to think</line>
                     <line>that I could beat them shooting with one hand. I</line>
                     <line>explained to them everything Jack had taught</line>
                     <line>me: Here I found a hunting pardner: D.S. had</line>
                     <line>to go to Chicago to go to school. this he told me.</line>
                     <line>On the way back to where the grave was. We</line>
                     <line>decided to get on the rock fence close to the gate</line>
                     <line>where we could see every thing. The fence was</line>
                     <line>five feet high. They helped me get on the fence</line>
                     <line>and put my dog on it to. We sat there through all</line>
                     <line>of the ceromony. This was an unusal day for me.</line>
                     <line>As I sat there I could see people coming</line>
                     <line>from all directions. I saw my grandfather and</line>
                     <line>ten other older Negroes. Most of them we all</line>
                     <line>called Uncle: They went in among the white</line>
                     <line>people. When I looked again they had been placed</line>
                     <line>at the head of the grave: There they stood with</line>
                     <line>their bald heads shining in the afternoon sun.</line>
                     <line>I knew that they had come to pay their respects</line>
                     <line>to a man that had been a great man that had</line>
                     <line>been their friend. I knew the white people of</line>
                     <line>Sewanee held a high appreciation of their loyalty.</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>I had already become to feel sentimental when</line>
                     <line>the cadets marched in by us. They were so proud</line>
                     <line>as they executed their comands. so gracefully.</line>
                     <line>My thoughts went to Grandpa. He was cleaned</line>
                     <line>up with a black suit on: I knew he would hear</line>
                     <line>his most confusing statements: The Comunion</line>
                     <line>of Saints. the Resrection. and his blessing</line>
                     <line>which he always said. A man borned of</line>
                     <line>a woman is in this world only a few days,</line>
                     <line>nd his heart is filled with trouble: I wonderd</line>
                     <line>if it could be that be thought this phrase was correct</line>
                     <line>because the earth was being fed back its own: I</line>
                     <line>always tried to find some way to make grandpa</line>
                     <line>right as I could for my part: Soon the cadets</line>
                     <line>fired the shoots of salute. Then Taps were blown.</line>
                     <line>My mind went back to when I was seven years</line>
                     <line>old when the cadets were my pride and joy.</line>
                     <line>I was a bit sad. D.S. spoke for the first time. Ask</line>
                     <line>me would I walk home with them. It was only</line>
                     <line>three hundred yards away. I was glad to do</line>
                     <line>so. I knew I had found a friend in them.</line>
                     <line>Reaching their home, D.S. introduced me to his</line>
                     <line>mother. Johnny began to tell her what friends</line>
                     <line>we were to be: This boy became the best friend</line>
                     <line>I had for four years: His mother treated me as if</line>
                     <line>I were a part of the family: Soon we began to</line>
                     <line>hunt together he did not care to profit in any</line>
                     <line>thing. He just liked the sport of it and to be with</line>
                     <line>me: Mrs. McKay gave us some lemonade. We drank</line>
                     <line>it, thanking her as I started to leave. D.S. said I suppose</line>
                     <line>you will be at St Agustus Sunday. There will be a lot</line>
                     <line>of the people their that came here for the funeral:</line>
                     <line>It will be a big turnout. I said Ill be there. This</line>
                     <line>was Friday. The next morning I went to</line>
                     <line>Dr. Seldons. He removed the brace from under</line>
                     <line>my arm, taped my shoulder with adhesive so.</line>
                     <line>that I could put my arm through the sleeve of</line>
                     <line>a coat. I rushed home and ask Ma could I</line>
                     <line>have fifty cents to get a hat to wear Sunday when</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>I would meet Johnny at the church. It had</line>
                     <line>been four years since I had. gone to Saint Agustus</line>
                     <line>to see the cadets march in: I knew I would see</line>
                     <line>many people that I used to know. I saw Father</line>
                     <line>Gerry at the cemertery. He had come here to</line>
                     <line>preside over this ceromony: as respect of this</line>
                     <line>great man. I told Mama about the Mc Kays.</line>
                     <line>She didnt know them. They hadnt lived in</line>
                     <line>Sewanee very long: That I learned latter. I still</line>
                     <line>could’nt shine shoes. Dr. warned me not to use</line>
                     <line>my left arm: I rarely wore a hat in the summer.</line>
                     <line>I explained to Mama, the reason I wanted a hat</line>
                     <line>was I could tip my hat like the men: I</line>
                    <line> would not have to bow: She smiled and shook</line>
                     <line>her head. With a shrug of her shoulders. Things</line>
                     <line>had cangdeed in every way since I had been,</line>
                     <line>I felt, adopted by the mountains: This I never</line>
                     <line>talked to any one except Tepsey my dog: All day</line>
                     <line>Saturday I planned what I first would</line>
                     <line>do. To start make money: Wild grapes was</line>
                     <line>ready. Lots of people bought them and muskadine.</line>
                     <line>I could make at least a half dollar a day.</line>
                     <line>What I couldnt sell Mama could use: Hunting</line>
                     <line>grapes Johnny and I could locate walnut</line>
                     <line>trees hickory nuts and chesnuts which we</line>
                     <line>could sell to the school boys: The school</line>
                     <line>boys were fond of nuts. They would by all I could</line>
                     <line>gather. Soon I would gather herbs to. I would</line>
                     <line>tell Johnny about it. Sunday morning I put on my</line>
                     <line>suit I had bought to go to school. This was the</line>
                     <line>first new suit I had owned. I had to go in bare</line>
                    <line> feet. I didnt have any dress shoes. The August</line>
                     <line>sun was bright and hot: I got to Saint Agustus</line>
                     <line>be fore anyone except the janitor who also</line>
                     <line>pumped the pipe organ. I wanted to see the</line>
                     <line>notables as they drove up in their carrages.</line>
                     <line>Soon D.S. and Johnny arived. I told them I</line>
                     <line>wanted to be where I could see the approach of</line>
                     <line>everyone: We waited: Soon we could see that</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>people were coming from all directions. Some</line>
                     <line>walked some in carrages. Ladies were mostly</line>
                     <line>dressed in white with parasoils. Many used</line>
                     <line>rented carrages. Which was called hacks:</line>
                     <line>mostly owned by Henry Hoskins: We watched</line>
                     <line>he carrages drive up and unload. I was hoping</line>
                     <line>to see Vice Chanselor Wiggins. drive up. He had the</line>
                     <line>finest span of horses. he and Professer Gray and</line>
                     <line>carrage: They only lived a half block from the</line>
                     <line>church. I saw he and Mrs Wiggins as they crossed</line>
                     <line>the street. He like most of all the notables. carried</line>
                     <line>a walking stick. His silk hat glittering in the sun:</line>
                     <line>By this time the street was full of people. Every one</line>
                     <line>was greeting one another. The carrage that had</line>
                     <line>stopped beside us; Gave me a joyful thrill. This</line>
                     <line>lady I admired her so much, Miss Sally Mallady</line>
                     <line>whom I hadnt seen in three years. She and</line>
                     <line>lady Gallier was riding in her carrage. She was</line>
                     <line>the type of lady that made her presence felt where</line>
                     <line>ever she appeared: I steped forward catching the</line>
                     <line>reins close to the horses bridle. Mr Colmore who</line>
                    <line> most of the students called him General He</line>
                     <line>was the Dean: of the schools: he wand his to</line>
                     <line>daughter, Miss Dora and Miss Eva, and Miss</line>
                     <line>Hodson; Had just walked up. He assisted these</line>
                     <line>to ladies out of the carrage: After their greetings</line>
                     <line>Miss Malady looked to see who was holding her</line>
                     <line>horse: She said why Ely you little scrapper I</line>
                     <line>havent see you for a time: She said Take the</line>
                     <line>weight out of the buggy. Snap the strap to his</line>
                     <line>bit ring. Joe will wait for me meaning the</line>
                     <line>horse. This was somthing I had done for her when</line>
                     <line>I was a small boy; When she would drive up</line>
                     <line>to the. Supply Store. She was always busy like</line>
                     <line>most of this class of people. She was a brave</line>
                     <line>woman. She drove her horse like any man could.</line>
                     <line>She often would drive into the colored settlement</line>
                     <line>to see about people that was sick driving her</line>
                     <line>carrage over diches and rough roads. She had</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>many times when she would be going my</line>
                     <line>direction stop her horse and tell me to get in the</line>
                     <line>carrages. She would drop me off where it was most</line>
                     <line>conveient for me: She was just a great lady like</line>
                     <line>all of these people. As they walked away the</line>
                     <line>Curbysmiths drove up Miss. Bessie and Miss</line>
                     <line>Carry. they were sisters the remainder of the</line>
                     <line>General Curbysmith family. They had a colored</line>
                     <line>butler so the story was told to me. That the</line>
                     <line>General had raised from a small boy. His</line>
                     <line>name was Ed. He was said to be the finest</line>
                     <line>butler in town. They treated him like he was</line>
                     <line>one of the family: These ladys mostly drove</line>
                     <line>for them selves. They used a one seat</line>
                     <line>carrage. When. Ed had to go with them to keep from</line>
                     <line>wrinkling their dresses. One of them would sit</line>
                     <line>in Eds lap and the other would drive. They drove</line>
                     <line>up in this style. The gentlemen helpt them</line>
                     <line>from their buggy. Ed stayed to care for the</line>
                     <line>horses: The cadets was now approaching about</line>
                     <line>to blocks away. Johnny and I got in Miss Maladys</line>
                     <line>carrage so we could see over the crowd. There</line>
                     <line>was to me the most wonderful sight to look at.</line>
                     <line>It was the most regrettable experience for me when</line>
                     <line>I learned. I could never be a cadet. Here they came</line>
                     <line>a colum of individual human being swaying</line>
                     <line>with syncronize motion keeping caden with</line>
                     <line>the music of the band. coming to give their respect</line>
                     <line>to God: Johnny touched me on the arm and said</line>
                     <line>Two years from now I will be a cadet. This was</line>
                     <line>the time. I found that I enveyed Johnny. I did</line>
                     <line>answer him. He said, This is new uniforms</line>
                     <line>they are wearing Its like the West Point cadets.</line>
                     <line>Very few people had gone in the chapel. Most of</line>
                     <line>the people were so fond of their cadets: As the</line>
                     <line>cadets marched by us. I saw an officer that</line>
                     <line>I knew. He was once a cadet. I hadent seen</line>
                     <line>him for many years. He was dressed</line>
                     <line>different than the cadets. He wore a blue coat</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>Gray pants with a yellow stripe on each side of</line>
                  <line>the legs. the spreaded eagle on his cap, medals on</line>
                  <line>on his breast a silver leaf on his shoulder. I knew</line>
                  <line>he was a high ranking military officer. He and</line>
                  <line>Captain Gillam. Had marched in front of the</line>
                  <line>cadets. He gave the comand that formed company</line>
                  <line>front. Then the filed off two abreast marching into</line>
                  <line>the Chapel. Every body proceeded after </line>
                  <line>them. Johnny ask me was I going in. I said no</line>
                  <line>you go. I will be in front when you come out.</line>
                  <line>Johnny went with his brother. I rushed to the</line>
                  <line>back of the Chapel where the choir assembled</line>
                  <line>to march in and the officials There were</line>
                  <line>many visiting Bishops, and Bishop Gailor </line>
                  <line>was there that was the last time I saw him.</line>
                  <line>I always felt these men had to be next to God.</line>
                  <line>It was beautiful to look at these men with their</line>
                  <line>gowns some black, some purple with white corters</line>
                  <line>and decorated stroles. repersenting their significance</line>
                  <line>to divenity: When they marched in I went to the</line>
                  <line>street to look at the horses and carraeges.</line>
                  <line>All of these were driven by colored men except</line>
                  <line>one. That was Proffes Grays. He had the only</line>
                  <line>white servent in Sewanee that worked around</line>
                  <line>the estate: Their were many colored butlers on </line>
                  <line>the street that worked in homes nearby had</line>
                  <line>take a chance to see the gathering. All of them</line>
                  <line>neatly dressed: This was much incoruged by these</line>
                  <line>notables to these servants to be emmaculate at all</line>
                  <line>times you rarely saw any servant on the street</line>
                  <line>with out  tie on. As I walked along passing many</line>
                  <line>their sat Mamy Gillam. Setting there waiting for Mrs</line>
                  <line>Gilliam to return She didnt go in the Chapel as</line>
                  <line>usual. I supose it was tomuch of a crowd for her:</line>
                  <line>Her white hair gathured to the top of her head</line>
                  <line>with a small turban on her brown skin, her</line>
                  <line>large eyes.Sitting in a dignifyed way as if she</line>
                  <line>was a queen: At this time I could almost</line>
               </surface>
               <surface>
                  <line>worship the so called black mamy. Untill</line>
                  <line>later as I will tell you; I went to Miss Malady</line>
                  <line>carrage an sat there untill service was over.</line>
                  <line>There were many students in premises that could</line>
                  <line>not get in the chapel. They were in groups talking</line>
                  <line>along came a fine looking big strong black</line>
                  <line>man. He was the farther of a small child that</line>
                  <line>I had given some of the toys that I stole from</line>
                  <line>the white children. he was the only Person that</line>
                  <line>knew I was stealing. He was the cause of me</line>
                  <line>I hadint seen him in three years. He</line>
                  <line>stopped and ask me was I trying to be a good</line>
                  <line>boy. He said I am now top trainer for the</line>
                  <line>varsity team. Saturday afternoons if you will</line>
                  <line>come to the gymnasuem. You can get some</line>
                  <line>shoe shining to do: His name was Willie.</line>
                  <line>Some of the students reconized him. and</line>
                  <line>Called him Six.: A number of them chated a</line>
                  <line>bit with  about. The coming team. When they</line>
                  <line>subsided I ask him why do they call you</line>
                  <line>Six. He laughed then he said its because I</line>
                  <line>have big feet. They give me so many shoes</line>
                  <line>and I cant wear any of them. They kid me</line>
                  <line>by saying I wear the size twelve. So for</line>
                  <line>short is Six: He was as humorisk as he was lovable</line>
                  <line>to know. Little did I ore he think that</line>
                  <line>he would serve on that job for fourty years</line>
                  <line>as one of the finest trainers of any</line>
                  <line>coledge in the South. Some of the people had</line>
                  <line>began to come out of the Chapel. I went close </line>
                  <line>to the Chapel so as to see every body when they</line>
                  <line>came out. Johnny and S.A. was already out</line>
                  <line>on the steps. We stood back a distance on</line>

                  <line>a new church. This is what this is all a</line>
                  <line>bout. There is going to be a corner stone</line>
                  <line>laying next spring: It will be called Saint</line>
                  <line>Agustus Cathedral: That excavating over</line>

               </surface>
                  <surface>
                     <line>We were standing on the side of the grounds just</line>
                     <line>off the walkway on the lawn: Every body going</line>
                     <line>that direction would have pass by us. The cadets</line>
                     <line>to: most every had come of of the chapel when the</line>
                     <line>cadets came out: This day the cadets stole the</line>
                     <line>show. Most of the notables of the men stood</line>
                     <line>just across from us: The cadets went into formation</line>
                     <line>and marched by them. This officer with this</line>
                     <line>odd uniform. Was Major Archybald Butt: S.A.</line>
                     <line>had been told by someone who he was. He use</line>
                     <line>to a cadet when he was in school: I knew I</line>
                     <line>to a cadet when he was in school: I knew I</line>
                     <line>had seen him before. Now he is President Teddy</line>
                     <line>Rosevelts body guard and right hand man.</line>
                     <line>As the cadets marched by the command was</line>
                     <line>given eyes right: Major was standing out</line>
                     <line>from the rest of the crowd. This was a</line>
                     <line>respect to him. When they had marched out</line>
                     <line>The people came into the walkway. Greeting</line>
                     <line>the visiting guests.The Bishops were standing</line>
                     <line>on the steps and many ministers. Many of</line>
                     <line>the people were greeting the Bishops I went</line>
                     <line>up to shake hands with Bishop Gailor.</line>
                     <line>I hadnt been close to him since. I was four</line>
                     <line>years old. When I was babtized. And he</line>
                     <line>said he was my God father. I am sure he</line>
                     <line>knew who I was. He grasp my hand gently</line>
                     <line>with his right and patted the back of my hand</line>
                     <line>with his left saying God bless you. I was</line>
                     <line>having a hard time trying to keep my toes</line>
                     <line>from being steped on. When I got clear of the</line>
                     <line>mass of greeters to the Bishops: I was in the</line>
                     <line>middle of the walkway. Where Major Butt:</line>
                     <line>Was standing. People were greeting him. Many</line>
                     <line>I started by him: I was trying to recall where</line>
                     <line>did I ever see him. Just then. I realized that he</line>
                     <line>was the officer acting. With the cadets when</line>
                     <line>I used to try to keep up with for the two blocks</line>
                     <line>on Sunday mornings: I stood looking up at</line>
                     <line>him my hat in my hand. Very close to him were</line>
                  </surface>
                  <surface>
                     <line>many young ladys I knew. Miss Johnny</line>
                     <line>Tucker The Kirby Smiths, Ladys, Miss Dora Colmore</line>
                     <line>Miss Sarah Hodson. and Frank Gailor the</line>
                     <line>Bishops son. They saw me standing back</line>
                     <line>of the Major, I suppose starrying at him</line>
                     <line>Frank said to Major: You have and admirer</line>
                     <line>and nodded his head toward me. Major</line>
                     <line>turned and looked at me. and said Ely. then</line>
                     <line>extended his hand then said I would know</line>
                     <line>that sandy. Curly head any where. He lead me</line>
                     <line>to these ladys and said is the youngest</line>
                     <line>cadet I ever knew. He will be a military</line>
                     <line>man some day: When he was very small</line>
                     <line>he used to march with us on Sunday morning</line>
                     <line>He had to run to keep up. I was so berden with</line>
                     <line>sentementality, that I was petrified. I just</line>
                     <line>couldint speak. Mr. Hodson who ran the bank</line>
                     <line>Miss Sarah Hodsons brother. Taken the</line>
                     <line>Major by the arm then they walked away</line>
                     <line>with the young ladys I watched them as they</line>
                     <line>crossed the street and entered he Hodsons</line>
                     <line>broad drive way. to the estate: S.A. and</line>
                     <line>Johnny was still waiting for me. To come</line>
                     <line>to them. It was now one oclock: every body in</line>
                     <line>Sewanee went to dinner at this hour. I told</line>
                     <line>Johnny. I would see them the next day. They</line>
                     <line>departed for home. Miss Malady and a number</line>
                     <line>of her set. Were in a groupe talking. I was</line>
                     <line>glad to see that she had not gone. I would</line>
                     <line>hold the horse and put the hitch weight back</line>
                     <line>in her buggy for her. Soon she came and</line>
                     <line>the lady who was with her. Dr. Hall assisted</line>
                     <line>them into the carrage. I had put the weight</line>
                     <line>in. I was holding Joe. by the reins. She thanked</line>
                     <line>Dr. Hall. then said to me. Ely, you have been</line>
                     <line>most kind looking after me. Here she held</line>
                     <line>out her hand and drops a quarter in mine.</line>
                     <line>I bowed and thanked her: She smiled and said</line>
                     <line>to the lady. Ely is a aristocrat. Then said good bye.</line>
                  </surface>
                  <surface>
                     <line>I was hungry. I knew I could go to Miss</line>
                     <line>Emma Tuckers. I was always welcome. like</line>
                     <line>most all of colored people that she knew.</line>
                     <line>There I went. On the way I was thinking</line>
                     <line>Miss Sally had said I was a aristicrat.</line>
                     <line>I felt very proud to think. Even if I am not</line>
                     <line>white: I am sombody. You have to be to be</line>
                     <line>a aristicrat. I am going to ask Father Eastern.</line>
                     <line>just what a aristicrat is: and why: at the</line>
                     <line>Tucker house was many people. She had extra</line>
                     <line>help this day. For the help and colored people</line>
                     <line>table was set under a big oak tree. I went to the</line>
                     <line>cook name Elnora. and ask her could I be of</line>
                     <line>help. to her. She said Oh Lord yes. She tossed</line>
                     <line>an apron to me. saying. Clean up the pot vessels</line>
                     <line>empty those slop cans in the back. Your Grand</line>
                     <line>papy isnt here today. You can do his job:</line>
                     <line>Half an hour I had finished the job She gave me</line>
                     <line>a plate of food. Saying You can eat now. heavens</line>
                     <line>know when we will finish feeding this crowd</line>
                     <line>I was hopeing we had fried chicken and candy</line>
                     <line>yam potatoes which it was. and peach ice</line>
                     <line>cream. I stuffed my self on ice cream. I told</line>
                     <line>Elnora that I thank her. I must be on my </line>
                     <line>way to Sunday School. As I was leaving I met</line>
                     <line>Mr. and Mrs. Rosebourh coming into the grounds.</line>
                     <line>He called to me to come to them. I went with my</line>
                     <line>hat in my hand like I had seen grandpa do.</line>
                     <line>He said You are growing up to be a fine looking</line>
                     <line>boy. Some day I want you to be my house</line>
                     <line>man. Do you belong to the choir at your</line>
                     <line>church. I told him yes he ask what night</line>
                     <line>did we practice. I told him that Proffeser</line>
                     <line>Sharp who trained the Saint Argustus choir</line>
                     <line>trained us on Friday night. He said good.</line>
                     <line>I want you to escort my wife on Thursday</line>
                     <line>nights to her bridge club. This night I am</line>
                     <line>always very busy. I dont like her to be on</line>
                     <line>the street alone. There often are these sagers</line>
                  </surface>
                  
                  <surface>
                     <line>going through the corporation to the valley</line>
                     <line>I just dont trust them. I will pay you fifty </line>
                     <line>cents each night. So be at my house Thursday</line>
                     <line>evening at seven oclock. He ask what was</line>
                     <line>wrong with my shoulder. I told him what</line>
                     <line>happen. He said this poor white trash. is a</line>
                     <line>bad lot. The Mrses smiled and said I will</line>
                     <line>mean to give me a good looking boy friend</line>
                     <line>Irvin. She pulled her parasoil back as he placed</line>
                     <line>a kiss. They went into the grounds. Now I</line>
                     <line>have almost all I can do I can make money</line>
                     <line>every day some way. On my way to Sunday</line>
                     <line>School. I thought a lot about how the Sewanee</line>
                     <line>people were so different. from white people in</line>
                     <line>other towns. The dont trust their own race</line>
                     <line>here. To them I am a Negro: They trust we</line>
                     <line>Negros more so than their poor. white people.</line>
                     <line>I am called a aristicrat. This must mean be</line>
                     <line>ing very good. I will do everything I can</line>
                     <line>to be of good. As I started down the hill. here</line>
                     <line>was Dr. West pushing his small auto up the hill.</line>
                     <line>I ran to help him. This was the first automobile </line>
                     <line>that was owned by anyone in Sewanee. It was</line>
                     <line>called a Brush. It had one cylinder. Not much</line>
                     <line>power. It could not climb the hill with him in </line>
                     <line>it. He had to put it so the clutch could move it</line>
                     <line>then push it to help the engine untill it was</line>
                     <line>on top, the outrun it, and get in it. I helped him</line>
                     <line>up the hill. He was going to the villidge on</line>
                     <line>a call. Which was close to my chapel. He</line>
                     <line>taken me with him. When I got to the chapel</line>
                     <line>nearly all of the Bishops and visiteng</line>
                     <line>ministers came. This day I was made cross</line>
                     <line>bearer of the choir: Many white people</line>
                     <line>came to our chapel. They spent much time</line>
                     <line>talking to we colored people. There were</line>
                     <line>ectures given by many of the minesters.</line>
                     <line>When service was over we all walked through</line>
                  </surface>
                  
                  <surface>
                     <line>corporation. This was somewhat a habit</line>
                     <line>of us, to show respect to our superiors</line>
                     <line>of divinity. Many of the white people would</line>
                     <line>be walking in the afternoon sun. It was a</line>
                     <line>custom with them to speak to every one of us.</line>
                     <line>I have heard them say to their their servants and</line>
                     <line>to colored. That they knew: How nice you looked</line>
                     <line>Sunday: This of course was encouraged every</line>
                     <line>colored person to look his best, and to be</line>
                     <line>emaculate as they could. Most of our clothes were</line>
                     <line>second handed. Clothes was about the cheapest</line>
                     <line>buy we had buy: With seven hundred men</line>
                     <line>students, most of them rich mens sons. The</line>
                     <line>cast-off ore cheap sales kept every colored man</line>
                     <line>well dressed: These white people were very</line>
                     <line>proud of their colored servants. I have heard </line>
                     <line>them, even the school boys, critersize the</line>
                     <line>poor sagers. For the way they look. They</line>
                     <line>wouldnt even speak to them. Scandel was</line>
                     <line>somthing you never heard about the white people</line>
                     <line>They had every thing under such control that</line>
                     <line>if a schoolboy was expelled no one knew why</line>
                     <line>All you knew was hes gone &#x2234; As we approached</line>
                     <line>the street where the Hotel was. There were</line>
                     <line>many carrages in the street, many ladys</line>
                     <line>walking. It seemed everyone spoke to some</line>
                     <line>of us: Most of this prossesion was young</line>
                     <line>people ranging from ten years old to twenty:</line>
                     <line>No older colored people attended Sunday </line>
                     <line>School. I knew these boys and girls would go</line>
                     <line>to Morgan Steep. There they would watch the</line>
                     <line>sunset set, like the tourist do. They walk</line>
                     <line>back home in the twylight: This was a rom</line>
                     <line>tic place to at that hour of day: I had walked</line>
                     <line>with three of the Fathers. As we reached the Supply</line>
                     <line>Store they left us to go in the store. I followed</line>
                     <line>the to the steps. I said to one of them, Father</line>
                     <line>will you please tell me what a aristocrate is. He</line>
                     <line>looked at other two and smiled. Then said a man</line>
                     <line>of character person who stands for virture. I thank him.</line>
                  </surface>
                  
                  <surface>
                     <line>and joined the other boys: Feeling most proud that a</line>
                     <line>Negro must not be aristocrat. So I know I am not a</line>
                     <line>Negro slave: I was happy to have a friend like Johnny</line>
                     <line>McKay &#x2234; who wanted to go with me in the mountains.</line>
                     <line>I had been selected to be a bodygaurd for Mrs. Ross</line>
                     <line>bourgh &#x2234; and maybe other ladies would hire me &#x2234; now</line>
                     <line>I can make some money everyday &#x2234; As I passed Mrs.</line>
                     <line>Beesleys house &#x2234; she ask me would I like to sell choclate</line>
                     <line>Fudge and crulers at the games on Saturday at the</line>
                     <line>park &#x2234; She would give me a fourth of what I made:</line>
                     <line>On Saturdays I made one dollar and a quarter to my</line>
                     <line>part &#x2234; : This made selling made me popular with all</line>
                     <line>the students &#x2234; Johnny and I would go into the mount-</line>
                     <line>ings three days a week &#x2234; We soon knew every trail</line>
                     <line>in the mountains. I had located almost every</line>
                     <line>herb bed and scally bark grove and chestnuts trees:</line>
                     <line>and wild grape harbours in the mountains for</line>
                     <line>five miles arounds &#x2234; His female bull terrior that</line>
                     <line>we had bred to Pro, Grays champion pointer</line>
                     <line>named Dash &#x2234; soon delivered three fine pups &#x2234;</line>
                     <line>His mother refused to let him keep not one of them &#x2234;</line>
                     <line>I had to keep them all &#x2234; We never dreamed of what</line>
                     <line>hunting dogs this cross breed would would</line>
                     <line>make &#x2234; Jack Prince trimed their ears. They looked</line>
                     <line>like small mastiffs. By hard and patient training</line>
                     <line>at two years old they were the finest coon dogs</line>
                     <line>and wild hog &#x2234; and bird dogs in the mountains &#x2234;</line>
                     <line>This year nineteen and eight: We hunted with</line>
                  </surface>
                  
                  <surface>
                     <line>small bow and arrows &#x2234; uising unbrallow staves</line>
                     <line>for arrows. It was most effective for forty feet.</line>
                     <line>an acurate &#x2234; We both could place a arrow in a</line>
                     <line>six inch circle at that distant &#x2234; This year I only</line>
                     <line>collected nuts berry herbs grapes flowers muscadines</line>
                     <line>We killed some rabbits and three ground hogs &#x2234;</line>
                     <line>Down under Greens View I had an expereince. I </line>
                     <line>havent been able to decipher just why it has</line>
                     <line>stayed with me &#x2234; and how it came before me</line>
                     <line>ten years later during a most perilist moment</line>
                     <line>in my life &#x2234; At Gorman, Texas, I was persued to</line>
                     <line>be mobbed. I was hemmed in like that</line>
                     <line>groundhog &#x2234; I had no choice &#x2234; except die fight</line>
                     <line>ing &#x2234; To surrender would be certain death &#x2234; So if I</line>
                     <line>killed the sheriff I would die also &#x2234; All I could do</line>
                     <line>was pray for Gods help &#x2234; This groundhog</line>
                     <line>came so vivid before me &#x2234; and the words</line>
                     <line>He will walk away be brave be patient as</line>
                     <line>you wont be harmed &#x2234; The sheriff did at</line>
                     <line>that moment &#x2234; The outcome of this came three</line>
                     <line>hours later as you will read in Texas travel</line>
                     <line>on the wings of a prayer &#x2234; . I have no answer</line>
                     <line>for this experience. I leave it to you &#x2234; Johnny </line>
                     <line>was a Christian boy. We had a lot in common &#x2234; </line>
                     <line>He added a lot of happiness in my life &#x2234; My body</line>
                     <line>guard business grew to. I was soon employed</line>
                     <line>two nights a week. To escort the ladies to different</line>
                     <line>houses &#x2234; and wait untill the bridge partys was</line>
                  </surface>
                  
                  <surface>
                     <line>over &#x2234; For almost two years I was busy with my</line>
                     <line>mountain collections and waiting on my white</line>
                     <line>people &#x2234; I rarely had anything to do with my</line>
                     <line>colored people except on Sundays at Sunday</line>
                     <line>School &#x2234; At this time we were blessed to have the</line>
                     <line>fine Father sent to us named Stoney &#x2234; He had</line>
                     <line>a friend name Ambroster &#x2234; These two men gave</line>
                     <line>much time to training our young boys to be</line>
                     <line>good athelethes &#x2234; Father Stoney liked me very</line>
                     <line>much. He knew much of my troubles. He often</line>
                     <line>talked to me: encourged me to take care of</line>
                     <line>my mama. He also tried to get me to go to</line>
                     <line>St. Marys to school &#x2234; He and Ambroster would</line>
                     <line>coach our two teams, both foot ball and base</line>
                     <line>ball &#x2234; We had the best teams of colored in</line>
                     <line>the South &#x2234; At this time we had all kinds of </line>
                     <line>intertainments. cake walks, minestrals</line>
                     <line>concerts &#x2234; Fisk University and Me Harry. Teams</line>
                     <line>were invited to come and play with us. The</line>
                     <line>whole town would turn out to see us play.</line>
                     <line>The summer of nineteen and eight Ann came</line>
                     <line>back to Sewanee on a visit. She bought a goat</line>
                     <line>an wagon. The most beautiful goat I ever</line>
                     <line>saw, from some tureist &#x2234; That was here. The</line>
                     <line>wagon was a exact copy of the Tenn. Wagon</line>
                     <line>Co &#x2234; She gave it to me so I could rent it out</line>
                     <line>to the children at twenty five cents per hour</line>
                     <line>.This would earn a dollar a day. I was in</line>
                  </surface>
                  
                  <surface>
                     <line>business now. I worked Billy for two seasons. I</line>
                     <line>made many friends among the tourists. Billy</line>
                     <line>Billy and I had our pictures take many times every</line>
                     <line>day &#x2234; Our pictures went to every city in the South:</line>
                     <line>After the summer season &#x2234;  I done a wood yard</line>
                     <line>business. Cutting stove wood, selling to all the</line>
                     <line>colored people twenty cints a load. I would</line>
                     <line>haul clothes, spring water &#x2234; I met many fine</line>
                     <line>people. Many of them wanted me to go away</line>
                     <line>with them. This all ended at the end of nine</line>
                     <line>teen and nine &#x2234; That fall &#x2234; I had been confronted</line>
                     <line>with two experiences that left a memory. That</line>
                     <line>was hard to forget &#x2234; All of my trade was at </line>
                     <line>the hotel &#x2234; One morning a tall blond man came</line>
                     <line>to me and told me he wanted me to ride his</line>
                     <line>daughter every morning for a month. He said</line>
                     <line>his name was Fletcher. He was from Ohio &#x2234;</line>
                     <line>His daughter was named Nancy &#x2234; She was the</line>
                     <line>sweetest child I had served. He and his wife</line>
                     <line>both were so kind. After a couple of weeks</line>
                     <line>he paid fifty cents each day &#x2234; One morning</line>
                     <line>he ask me a lot of questions: all about who</line>

                     <line>to ride. Everybody was leaving the vacation</line>
                     <line>was over &#x2234; As I started home I met a blond</line>
                     <line>lady and a boy and a girl. The little girl ran</line>
                     <line>to me, asking could she Pat the goat. She</line>
                     <line>caught me by the hand laughing and</line>
                     <line>holding to my hand, saying I like you.</line>

                     <line>to take a ride. The girl ask me to hold her in</line>
                     <line>my arms so she could Pat the goat on his back.</line>
                     <line>I did: The lady stood a distance from us just</line>
                     <line>looking. I hadnt seen her for several years:</line>
                     <line>Once in a toy store she told the owner to</line>
                     <line>let me have anything I wanted and charge</line>
                     <line>it to her &#x2234; I had ask the storekeeper who she</line>
                     <line>was. But he didnt tell me. &#x2234; I put them in the</line>
                     <line>wagon. The lady said dont go very far. I will</line>
                     <line>wait here &#x2234; On our return. The girl didnt want</line>

                     <line>child out of the wagon &#x2234; Tossing me a half</line>
                     <line>dollar: Telling me to get going &#x2234; I went on</line>

                  <line>hogs&#2234; I went strait to Farther Ticen. Telling him</line>
                  <line>about this dog&#2234; We went hunting that night. Shep:</line>
                  <line>treed two coons&#2234; This inspired us and our dogs&#2234;</line>

                  <line>worth of fur in the next two years&#2234; We often</line>
                  <line>had hunting partys. That would jouin us to</line>

               <surface>
                  <line>dollars a week I made: kept us eating&#2234; I must tell this</line>
                  <line>ghost story: I was discouraged buy are attempted to be</line>
                  <line>buy many of the Negros&#2234; Telling I would be found</line>
                  <line>dead in the mountains: I was told of two places that</line>
                  <line>ghost had run hunters away&#2234; I had excepted it as</line>
                  <line>a joke after. Father Stoney told me there was no such</line>
                  <line>thing as a haunt&#2234; He said people who supported</line>
                  <line>fear might beleive anything&#2234; This was the first</line>
                  <line>time I had heard this phrase: That fear was mans</line>
                  <line>worse enemy&#2234; The third night I started to Proctors</line>
                  <line>Hall to go down the mountian there was a trail.</line>
                  <line>As I passed the Cheap home&#2234; I thought of the ghost</line>
                  <line>story I had heard&#2234; There had been a lady name</line>
                  <line>Nancy Crownover. She had been a victim of a fire. She</line>
                  <line>was found in the ruins&#2234; Everybody pondered over</line>
                  <line>this, as a mystery&#2234; That she didnt escape the fire&#2234;</line>
                  <line>Some fox hunters dogs struck a trial just pass</line>
                  <line>the Cheap home that lead to a hickory tree on a</line>
                  <line>hill four hundred yards away&#2234; The dogs acted</line>
                  <line>so misterious leaping in the air snaping at the</line>
                  <line>air. The men ran away. Claiming it was ghost</line>
                  <line>also. They claim they heard a women screaming up</line>
                  <line>this tree&#2234; No one hunted in this area&#2234; Because of this</line>
                  <line>rumor&#2234; A hundred yards past the Cheap home my dogs</line>
                  <line>struck a hot trail that caused them bay at this</line>
                  <line>lone tree on top of the hill&#2234; When I got to the tree&#2234; The</line>
                  <line>dogs was so excited they were gnawing the bark on</line>
                  <line>the trunk of the tree. I was sure we had a coon&#2234;</line>
               </surface>
               
               <surface>
                  <line>Soon I could see there was nothing. I moon was high</line>
                  <line>and bright. I could see everything to the top of the tree&#2234;</line>
                  <line>and it was a tall one&#2234; It wasnt close to any other trees:</line>
                  <line>Just then the ghost story came to my mind&#2234; I decided</line>
                  <line>I would climb the to prove to the dogs they had lied.</line>
                  <line>The same performance I had heard of. Began the dogs</line>
                  <line>leaped in the air snapping at somthing running to</line>
                  <line>the woods yelping like they saw something above</line>
                  <line>them&#2234; I could feel cold chills down my back&#2234; I</line>
                  <line>knew I was seeking somthing I couldnt see&#2234; While I was</line>
                  <line>trying to find the answer. The came rushing back up</line>
                  <line>to the tree on a hot trail. And bayed again. I was so</line>
                  <line>puzzled. I decided I would clime the tree. I knew that</line>
                  <line>nothing had come by me&#2234; At that moment the dogs</line>
                  <line>began leaping in the air and racing down the hill&#2234;</line>
                  <line>yelping. I decided if I have stay here all night I am going</line>
                  <line>know what this is&#2234; Then I decided to build a fire</line>
                  <line>on the dark side of the tree&#2234; I gathered some dead</line>
                  <line>wood. As I was stacking it beside the tree&#2234; I heard</line>
                  <line>the dogs coming toward me on a hot trail. Just</line>
                  <line>then I felt somthing run up my leg to the top</line>
                  <line>of my head and leapet off to the tree. I just glimsed</line>
                  <line>it going up the tree. I thought it was a mouse&#2234;</line>
                  <line>The dogs crashed against me leaping up the side</line>
                  <line>of the tree. As I backed away. I saw Shep was standing</line>
                  <line>twenty feet from the tree as if waiting like he did</line>
                  <line>for a coon to jump from the tree: As he knew their</line>
                  <line>habits to intercept them: Suddently the dogs leapet</line>
               </surface>
               
               <surface>
                  <line>in up as before and ran down the hill all except</line>
                  <line>Shep. I saw he was shaking somthing he was holding</line>
                  <line>in his mouth&#2234; I made him drop it. To find it was</line>
                  <line>a flying squirrel&#2234; The had a den in the hollow</line>
                  <line>of this tree&#2234; They to come up hill a foot. Would leap</line>
                  <line>of the tree and glide down to the other trees&#2234; Shep</line>
                  <line>had solved the habit. And caught it as he opened</line>
                  <line>his wings to glide&#2234; Dr. Judge. Had told me the</line>
                  <line>flying squirrel was kin to the bat both belong</line>
                  <line>to the mice family&#2234; Here I knew the ghost story</line>
                  <line>was a hoax&#2234; As soon as I let each dog smell of</line>
                  <line>it they were under control agan&#2234; We went on our</line>

                  <line>I had the most narrow escape of my life of</line>
                  <line>all of my experience in the mountain. I had</line>
                  <line>drilled many honey holes for coons. At the</line>
               </surface>
               
               <surface>
                  <line>water fall under Morgan Steep. Wich was our</line>
                  <line>swimming hole. There was a log with one end</line>
                  <line>in the swimming hole. I drilled a honey hole</line>
                  <line>in the log on the end out of the water&#x2234; When I</line>
                  <line>came around the edge of the cliff. I didnt see the</line>
                  <line>coon: He evidently slide down on the other side</line>
                  <line>so I couldnt see him&#x2234; After I had scaned</line>
                  <line>around the edge of the ledge to the top of the water</line>
                  <line>fall. I looked back to see the tail of a coon</line>
                  <line>hanging down at the end of the log&#x2234; I had to go back on the</line>
                  <line>trail ledge of the water fall.. I heard crashing and</line>
                  <line>rumbling up the canyonan. There was a cracking</line>
                  <line>of timber. I stopud and stood against the and a</line>
                  <line>big boulder: Soon I saw a avalanch of folidge</line>
                  <line>rolling over the water fall. Then a pillar of water</line>
                  <line>fifteen feet high drop over the fall with a churning</line>
                  <line>motion sending stones logs all direction. Everything</line>
                  <line>around me was vibrating. the water rose up</line>
                  <line>twenty feet during the churning I clung to the boulder</line>
                  <line>as water raced around waist deep&#x2234; The rushed</line>
                  <line>down the mountain as quickly as it came. I soon</line>
                  <line>sensed Hodson dam had broken&#x2234; This was the </line>
                  <line>first time. That become to know. God had his</line>
                  <line>arms around me. I stood by this boulder which</line>
                  <line>I had sat on many times medetating my troubles:</line>
                  <line>and one time. Had believed my mother had come</line>
                  <line>from Heaven and talked to me&#x2234; To me seeing the coon</line>

                  <line>in to see me and find them: I claim this spot as</line>
                  <line>water fall.. Here I taken shower baths before. Other</line>

                  <line>July we taken our first trip to Pittsburg Tenn&#x2234;</line>
                  <line>a coak oven and steel foundry town&#x2234; It was</line>
                  <line>sporty little burg&#x2234; a good laboring town like</line>
                  <line>Birmingham for colord people&#x2234; They had one of</line>
                  <line>the best ball clubs around. The white People</line>
                  <line>was fond of this team&#x2234; This was the first</line>
                  <line>automobile race I saw&#x2234; Three striped cars</line>
                  <line>raced down the street for a mile this was the</line>
                  <line>only street over four blocks long&#x2234; We could see</line>
                  <line>them as they Pass by. After that it was ten minutes</line>
                  <line>before you could see across the street for the dust.</line>
                  <line>We had a good time. That night they were having</line>
                  <line>a Prize fight&#x2234; No Negros were allowed to attend&#x2234;</line>
                  <line>I wanted to a Prize fight&#x2234; A colored boy I had known</line>
                  <line>at Bridge Port&#x2234; One of the boys had run me down</line>
                  <line>when I was running from the shouting Negros&#x2234;</line>
                  <line>His name was Pete Hill. He worked at a Livery</line>
                  <line>stable next to the building where the fight was to</line>
                  <line>be up on second floor. He told me we could climb</line>
                  <line>on top of the stable and look though the window&#x2234;</line>
               </surface>
                  
               <surface>
                  <line>It was a good fight&#x2234; I decided that I was going</line>
                  <line>to be a fighter. Jack Johnson had just beat</line>
                  <line>Jim Jefferis for the championship. This was the</line>
                  <line>only game that a negro could compete with</line>
                  <line>a white man&#x2234; Coming back home&#x2234; I had more</line>
                  <line>to tell than any one else&#x2234; Two weeks later we were</line>
                  <line>invited to Fedvill to play&#x2234; I had noticed there</line>
                  <line>were many half white Negros. More of them</line>
                  <line>than dark ones. I had wondered if they were</line>
                  <line>bastards&#x2234; During the game. One of our men</line>
                  <line>clektd the second basman this started a fight&#x2234;</line>
                  <line>The law rushed in to stop it&#x2234; While we were</line>
                  <line>listening to the advice of the law: Four middle</line>
                  <line>age white men said to us as they Pointed to some</line>
                  <line>of their Players. saying thats my son. If you</line>
                  <line>hit them with a bat Ill kill all you Sewanee</line>
                  <line>Niggers&#x2234; The game got under way. There was no</line>
                  <line>way for us to win. Because the white People</line>
                  <line>on the side line refreed the game. The umpire</line>
                  <line>mostly waited for their decision&#x2234; It was some</line>
                  <line>thing for me to think about. I was Sewanees</line>
                  <line>only half white bastard&#x2234; I had to fight all a</line>
                  <line>lone&#x2234; This was my last trip with the team. I</line>
                  <line>played when visiting teams came&#x2234; We didnt hold</line>
                  <line>any hard feeling against the Fedville People for</line>
                  <line>their way of wanting to win&#x2234; Ninteen and eight</line>
                  <line>Fisk Univ. came to Play our team. Sewanee was</line>
                  <line>leading by one touchdown: Nearing the end of the</line>
               </surface>
                  
               <surface>
                  <line>last period: Fisk was driving for the goal. Fist</line>
                  <line>down on the ten yard line&#x2234; They stalled there. It was</line>
                  <line>impossible to Penetrate the human wall of Sewanee.</line>
                  <line>I saw Grand Pa. Henry Woods Pink Sims and some white</line>
                  <line>students was hepling back up Sewanees line:</line>
                  <line>When the gun sounded. Fisk was still on the ten </line>
                  <line>yard line&#x2234; This is some of how the negro Played</line>
                  <line>ball down South fifty five years ago&#x2234; No matter</line>
                  <line>how it ended. it was just a matter of sport&#x2234; No</line>
                  <line>one held a grudge&#x2234; Because nobody wanted</line>
                  <line>to see their home town team loose&#x2234; In all towns</line>

From six to eight hours a day except sunday and Saturdays…The only money I spent was to buy cartridges for my pistol I practiced with it every day… My dogs got exercise and training to. This was when I trianed the two hushmouth dogs to be my body gaurds. They would let me know when we were apraching either man or animal a hundred yards away… This year I collected black walnuts ten sacks. Will Rae..let me dump the walnuts in his cow pen. The cow with their split hoofs cleaned the hull off. Then I put the walnut on top of the hous to let the rain wash them and the sun seasoned them- I made over twenty dollars. from nuts grapes and muscadines… The first of nov. Mama and I counted our money in the jar for it was all in silver. We had thirty dollars: I taken ten dollars and got my rifle out of pawn: Mama was most happy her son had began to respond to the treatment… My troubles hadnt lessoned any. I was being threatened by some of the men about dating their wemon and girls…  I had two fights with some of the Sagers… One afternoon in the viledge, these were the Tick Bush sagers, one of them was the one had broken my collar bone three years ago… There were nine of them they attacked me in front of Mr. Rosbourgh store… They must have thought I was going to run like most of the colored boys</line>

Mr. Rosbourgh and Ambroster came out of the store and Mr. Sam Winn, and stoped the fight… All the Sagers quieted except the older Martin boy. He told them that he didnt like this nigger and he was going to beat hell out him and it wasnt any of their business… I hadnt heard a sager talk to no aristicrat like this before… Mr. Ambroster said to me do you want to fight him, I said yes, sir. Just keep the others back. He had trained me to box him self: He said to Mr. Rosbourgh an Winn… Let them fight. Ely can whip all of one at a time. The fight was on it didnt take long before Martin was bleeding from mouth and nose and one of his eyes was closed…Then his smaller brother taken it up. He was exactly my size. He was down on the ground quickly. Mr. Winn told them to get out of town… and not barther any more Colored People… This caused the sagers to attempt to revenge. That Friday night was a dance. at the Odd Fellows Hal… These Tick Bush sagers came in the dark close to a hundred yard with rifles, and shot at the dance hall. No one was injured. Many of the colored men had guns they returned the fire These sagers got on their mules an raced out of town… This was the only conflict I have known to happen beteen colored and white people… I knew this was not the last of my trouble… I was much alone.

                  <line>poor white people… Everything I had prayed for seem to come out right… The first of nov.  I droped all work and went in to the mountains to trap and hunt. I soon felt like I was where I belong… I never felt alone in the mountains… I had now a fine pack of English hounds. Father Tison had gone to N.Y. for a while. I had fallen air to his dogs that I wanted to use… This pack of dogs become to be the finest combination of dogs I have heard of… They consist of this type of stratagy: Two cold cold nose pot-lickor hounds to build up the trail. These English hound were faster than the cold nose they take up the trail then: When it was hot enough. I send the three hush mouth in. Two of them were crossed between pointer . These hush mouths were faster than the English hounds while Mr. Coon would be playing tricks toping trees the hush mouths would almost catch him on the ground… Thes hush mouths would tree as much as a quarter of a mile ahead of the closes hound… This way we never lost a coon unless he made it to a cave… Day hunting: the bird and bulldog cross: would point an retreave birds tree squirrells. Putting them on a leash they would track wild hogs… As the season opened. I found that almost every mountainere was now traping and hunting for fur. The news of how much I had made last year had caused these people to try hunting. I was confined</line>

                  <line>to just the two coves. Roark and Green View Cove… I traped in one and hunted in the other. It didnt take long for this pack of dogs to clean up the game as I was hunting every night. I skined everything that had hair from house cats to civet cats… By the first of Dec. I had striped these two canyons… There wasnt but one man that had good hunting dogs. His name was Mitchell. He was my friend… He had two sons… He lived beyond Two Mile Branch… I decided today I would go Mitchells and hunt with them tonight. leaving home at four oclock: It was foggy. I had to go near three miles. I went the railroad close to Tick Bush… Before leaving the railroad… I would avoid much of the wet follage. As I crossed a small trussel. my dogs struck up a hot trail in a shed of woods about five hundred yards away. They were headed toward me. I made ready to shoot whatever it was as it cross the track. I was expecting it to be a fox… This trussel was very low, not more than four feet high… I knew there was a wet weather stream coming down this drawl… The folliges was thick in the ravine… As I was sitting on the trussel. two turkeys raced through the opening at the bottom of the trussel. There was no chance for a shot… The dogs came across the tracks with their noses in the air going to the mountain edge. where the turkeys would glide away down the canyon… The dog soon came back…This was</line>

I told them of the way I discovered it was turkey… They resented my theory. Still claimed this place was haunted… This is the second ghost hunt… Colonel Colmore got the gobler. Mr Judd got one hen Doc Barton got the other… My traps began to be robed. some stolen… My dogs treed a coon in Shake Rag Hollow one night. Four men came to me, telling me their dogs had treed this coon and get away from here. Two of them had guns… I gave over to them. telling them not to try it again… I had a girl with me that had slipped out of her home just to be with me. This was why I didnt try to protect my own. I went to Jack Prince. telling him about the sagers. He advised me to move my traping to Tallys Fork… You will find more skunks on the southwest of the range than on the north… This was when I learned that some animal would migrate to the afternoon sun… Skunks was one of them.Dec. fifteenth I shiped my first shipment to F.C.

Ill stop by when I get back… Mama was most happy when I told her that Uncle Doss and I had become to be friends again… While eating supper. I told Mama what my next plans were. Scott was up and had supper with us… I could see Mama was most happy to have him on his feet… She said to me son, why dont you go to the concert tonight you havent gone out to anything for four months… They are going to have some swell doing tonight… I wish you would go. And dont have no fight… Dont pay attintion to what these niggers say. You are their betters… I knew this would be my last chance for the next three month… I dressed my best, I did smell like a polecat just now… Uncle Calvin Childress: put on a concert twice a year he was our organist at the chapel… He was a born musician: He couldnt read a single note of music: He played and directed by ear… Ten years ago he had a band. the first band Sewanee had… He still had many of the instriment in his care… He had tried to build another band. We boys just wasnt interested in music… The school house was packed… Many students attended from S.M.A.: and Father Stoneys friends at St Luke… I had heard that a young lady was visiting here from St. Charles KY… I hadnt seen her… She was a vocalist and a educated</line>

I had fallon in love for the first time… The concert was great success… After the concert there was a dance. The students left. We pushed the benches around the wall… Here was the strangest orchersty I ever heard of… Houston and Simon Smith Arlandus Rankin. Played autoharps. and blew harmonocus that was held by a brace on their shoulders. Uncle Calvin blew the cornet. His daughter beat the drums… This was Sewanees music: We danced by it… This beautiful girl was stormed by all the men… and older boys: I stood back alone as usal… looking on… They were trying to get her to dance… She I could see was trying to get clear of thems…She came to me and ask do you dance.

Because I did know how to talk romance… She refused to dance with any one else. I now began for the first time to feel important… I went to all the older people and girls asking them to have a treat on me. They sold ice cream and pop five cents a order. I had forty dollars half of it was one dollar bills. I held it in my hand. to show I had money to what I please… I knew this was more money than any of the young guys ever had… Every one I ask excepted… I could see this put everybody to thinking the little bastard isnt to bad to have around… My little sweet heart sinced the meaning quickly. She sang as we danced: She said we have stole the show. Lets go home. I want to be alone with you… We talked knowing we both were desperate in love with each other… We made our vows… Thinking there was nothing to blot our happiness… To find a few days latter, our familys protested our love affair… There had been a feud between of family from far back… We decided we would carry on reguardless. As she said we will live in sin if we have to. I wont give you up for no one… We then planned to meet in secret. as often as three times a week. She often sliped away and go hunting at night… This lasted for two</line>

                  <line>two months, when she had to go away. The next day after the concert, I went to Tallys Fork to look it over. I stood on Natural Bridge Rock looking over this large canyon, as it was shaped like a two prong fork, each cove from two to three miles long. Around the rims was rugged and clifty. Down in the chasm was several hundred acres of cane brake. I saw smoke from a cabin down at the base of the mountain. I headed for it. I wanted to meet some of the mountaineers. I had heard that there were a Negro lived over here, named Alf Cannon. I had seen him in the village. He was always with some sagers. No Negros in Sewanee knew him. Grandpa had spoke of him once. When I got to the cabin I saw two of the cutest little brown dolls about my age. The house was a tipical log house with a ball through the center. These girls stood looking at me, dressed just alike in gingham. I spoke, saying: Hello. They didnt speak. I ask if Alf Cannon live here. They just stood and looked at me. A woman appeared in the door, dressed like the girls. She ask: What do you want? I ask could I speak to Mr. Cannon. She went back into the house. Out come Cannon, asking: What do you want with me? I explained that I were going to do some trapping over here. Can you tell me about what game is in here? He said: Wild cats, coons and polecats. I ask him if he would hunt with me some. He said</line>

                  <line>No, I dont want no company, and dont come here bothering me and my family. He called his daughters in and shut his door. As I turned to leave, he opened the door and said: If you see hogs in the cane brake dont go in. They are wild, and slammed the door. This was the first and last talk I had with Alf Cannon. I met him many times on the trails. He wouldnt speak. They were most clean people you wish to see. I soon found there were lots of skunk dens, and they were big ones. There were lots of foxes and coon tracks, hog tracks everywhere. Working out the canyons I got turned around in the cane brake, and came out on the oppisite side. It was three miles back across the canyon. As I looked around I saw smoke three hundred yards away soaring over the trees. I knew someone lived there. Why did Cannon lie, claiming no one lived near here? I went to the house. There was a small white boy playing in the yard. I call. Hello. A woman came to the door dressed like all of the mountain woman in a Mother Hubbard dress, her hair dropping down her back. She wanted to know what I wanted. I ask was the man of the house at home. She said: Nope. He will be here soon. Wont you come in? I went to the house. I told her I was lost. I want to know if there was a way to Sewanee without crossing the canyon. She said: Wait untill my</line>

The little boy had been jabbering away asking about my dogs. The boy driving the oxes was darker than I, by two shades. He looked like a Indian. The little white boy said to me. That is my half brother. His name is Andy. His farther is a black man. He lives down in the canyon. Andy said: Hello. I said the same. Mr. Atkins came riding in on a blaze face black mare. He said hello as he got off his horse, asking: Who are you? I told him I was Ned Greens grandson. I want to ask about what kind of game is here in the canyon as I am going to trap. The wife came to the door, saying: Come in. Dinner is ready. He said: Come with us to dinner. The old gal has backbones, tatoes, cabbage sprouts, cracklin bread and blackberry cobler. He said: Any of old Neds family is good with me. I know you must be hungry. Its a long walk to Sewanee. We went in to the table. He was a goodlooking man to be a mountainere, a heavy black head of hair, that come low on his forehead, well built with broad shoulders. At the table Andy sat on one side by me. The little boy was seven years old. The blessing was like every man for himself. I was so shocked over the white</line>

                  <line>woman having a nigger baby, and a white man raising him, I couldnt talk for thinking and trying to listen. Little John kept jabbering. No one talked except Mr. Atkins and John. Andy just sat looking down at his plate. I knew he was like me: a man without a country. I was surprised to hear Mr. Atkins say: Andy is my adopted son. His father is name Alf Cannon, a black man who lives down the canyon. He is my closest neibor. The wife only spoke when she ask if you would have more food. Atkins told me all about the canyon and invited me to come and hunt with him and Andy. He said: We will have a wild hog run any time. He said: You know, Old Ned has a claim on the wild hogs he never used. You can now. Then I told him I owned one of Wat Cannons dogs. His name is Shep. He slammed his hand down on the table, saying: You own him? He is the smartest wild hog dog I have ever known. Come here and stay all night any time. We will have fun. He ask could I shoot. I told him I had graduated under Jack Prince, both rifle and pistol. He said: You and Jack are friends. Nuf sed. Ill try you out when we are through eating. I ask did he think I would have trouble with anyone resenting me trapping. He said: If you do, come to me. He said: Some times the Tick Bushers come in hunting hogs. They</line>

                  <line>are a dirty lot. Those Newbys and Skinners are a mean lot. If you run into them, dont even talk to them. They are always looking for trouble. I didnt talk of my troubles with them. When we were outside he tried my rifle, hitting everything he shot at. A tree lark settled on the rail fence close to fifty yards away. He ask: Are you good enough to get that bird? When I shot the bird tumbled to the ground. He slapped me on the back and said: Jack has really trained you. Thats dam good. He walked with me for a quarter of a mile to show me a trail to Sewanee that would save fully a mile. These people become to be the best friends I had in the mountains. Andy and I become to be close friends as we trapped and hunted for the next three months. On the way home I thought of what Grandpa had told me, not to talk about what I learned around the mountaineres. I was still puzzeled over Andys mama being a white woman, and why Alf Cannon being so selfish, I knew I haden better not talk of this to nobody. No Negro know about Andy. It all came clear now what Grandpa meant the day we talked about Wat Cannon. Alf Cannon is the nigger that they defended. This is why he keeps himself away from other Negros. I knew I would learn more about this in time. This I would seal my lips on, not talk it to no one. When I got home</line>

                  <line>home I had to take a repermanding from Mama. The gossipers had been to see her, telling her how I had squandered money last night showing out before this new girl. I said: I spent a dollar and thirty cents the entire night. Mama said: That could feed us for a week. She demanded my pistol, telling me not to see the girl any more. Tonight was the first time I refused to obey her. I ask her not to deny me of my guns. I am not going to be without them, so please dont ask me to. I said: I dont care what the niggers say about me any more. They are going to respect me from now on. Mama slapped me across the mouth, saying: Shut up. I went to my room and to bed. That was the end of it. I left the next morning at five oclock with twenty steel traps on my back. I headed for the Atkins home. Andy went with me into the canyon. He told me about some people that done hunting farther down the low lands near Sherwood. This was four miles from here. I wanted to see if I couldnt buy their furs at a profit. It was strange to think he knew every mountainere between his home and Sherwood, not one person in Sewanee. He hadnt ever been in Sewanee. I made a deal with him to run my traps on Sunday. I would give him half of the catch. I couldnt do this and be back for Sunday School. I hadnt missed but once</line>

                  <line>in three years. Two days later I had installed twenty deadfalls, some honey holes and snares. Andy knew every trail in each fork on two small canyons farther west that had no names. He and I made a trip five miles down the lowlands toward Sherwood. He was liked by everybody. Seemed no one treated him like he was a Negro. We went to five homes. I collected seventy pelts: foxes, skunks, coons, no possums, at the cost of fourteen dollars. Many of the pelts were skinned wrong, split and not cased. I showed these boys how to case the pelts, and said I would be back in three weeks. Everything was in my favor. Trapping was good for skunks. In ten days I caught thirty pelts. I lost all the coons in the cane brake on the stream where the coon roved. A coon in a trap had no defense against a wild hog. All I would find was just the coons leg in the trap. Wild hogs go out to find food at dawn like all wild animals. They would beat me to the traps. I gave up the coons. I didnt care to fatten hogs on coons. My dogs would take care of them. All of the skunks were of a large breed, and all most black. Half of them were appraised extra large. This caused the narrow stripe value to be one dollar and a quarter, the shorts two dollars, the blacks up to three dollars. Ten foxes was all I caught, three dollars apiece. I caught over a hundrd and fifty skunks out of this canyon in three months. Andy and I were in the mountains every hour I was</line>

He rather tell me to shoot it. One morning we met Alf Cannon on the trail. He passed us, didnt speak. I spoke to him. He didnt speak at all. I ask Andy didnt he and his father speak. He shook his head and quicken his steps to get away from me. I never mention his farther agan. I knew he realized he was without a country. Mrs. and John Atkins were the kindest people I have ever known. They made me welcome at all times. John Atkins almost went wild over this pack of dogs. I had to hunt with him once every week. When he discovered that Shep was said to be the smartest hog dog in the mountains, he planned we would do some wild hog hunting. He said: There is a boar in the canyon that everybody had tried to get him. He will weigh four hundred pounds. I know Shep will track him down. That dog knows how to get him out of the cave when we find him. You, Andy and I will get that devil. I have seen that dog work. He said: I have seen this hog. He is a mustang. His ears have been frozen off. He has no marks. He is anybodys hog that gets him. I want him. Many people has tried for five years. He gets away. They call him the devil. He has killed several dogs because they didnt know how to take of themselves.</line>

                  <line>He wont fool that old shepperd dog. It was the third week in January, just after a heavy snow. John said: The snow is melting. Bring your dog tommorrow. We will get that devil hog. Tracking will be easy. This was my first hog hunt. It was eight when I arrived at his house. There were two young men name Russels there that lived down the canyon. They were here to join the hunt. At the edge of the cane brake, John found the big foot tracks. He said: You will see what a smart dog you own. He tied a rope around Sheps neck, holding the rope like a leash. Shep began to switch his tail and moved along sniffing his nose. Soon he was on the right trail. We covered at least a mile meandering. the side of the mountain, stopping at a rocky ravine, where there was a cave about eight feet wide, three feet high. Shep stood whining and wagging his tail. John said: He is in there. I didnt know this cave was here. He taken the rope off of Shep, and said: Shep will bring him out. Ive seen him do it. You send him in. He told us all to get on a boulder. I told Shep to go get him. He went in the cave wagging his tail. Soon he let out some barks. We could hear the hogs snorting. Shep came out running for his life, the hogs after him. There were at least ten. The big boer was in front. Shep and the boer went down the mountain. The other hogs went around the ledge. This was a break for us.</line>

                  <line>The hoer had separated himself from the other hogs. This saved us of much trouble and danger. When Shep got to a level place he began circling with the boer right after him. After a couple of circles the boer stopt, just turning to keep his eyes on Shep. Then Shep stopt and walked to the boer. As he would rush at Shep and snarl at him, Shep would leap aside and repeat the same action over agan. I said: John, I am going to shoot him before he hurts my dog. John said: No, let Shep work him so as to take the pertness out of him. He wont want to run. When he is tired we will urge him close to the road, then kill him. Just at that moment the boar charged at Shep, running him into a patch of snow. Shep slipped flat on his stomach. The hog rushed on him, slashing at him too high. Shep didnt come to his feet as the boer expected. He rolled away; keeping close on the ground. The boer snared so hard, caused him to spin around. Shep came to his feet, starting agan antagonizing the hoer. John Atkins yelled: Did you see that dog? How he outsmarted that hog? I tell you that is the smartest dog ever in these mountains. I leaped off my boulder, telling John: I am going to kill that hoer now. He wont kill my dog. As I approached him he started to run down the mountain. John</line>

He raced to the bottom of the canyon, through the canebreak, up the other side over the fork to the other canyon, Shep and I within fifty yards of him. As we crossed the trail of Natural Bridge John Cooksey had to leap out of the trail to keep the boer from running over him. I knew he was looking for moonshine and not hogs. He yell somthing at me. I was running too fast with my rifle over my head to hear what he said. The hog headed up the canyon toward the Two Mile Branch waterfall. There he got boxed in. The zero weather a few days before had frozen huge ice sickles that blocked the passages under the first waterfall. The ledge also was covered with ice. He skidded and lost his footing, falling off twenty feet down on the ice below. Landing on his back he was parilized. He couldnt get to his feet again. As I started down to shoot him I heard a voice from the other side of the canyon, saying: Dont touch that hog, nigger. That is our hog. What in the hell are you doing over here? You dont have no claim on hogs. We are going to take that one. There were six of them, four with dog on leashes. The other two had rifles. They were a part of the Tick Bush gang.

They had started to raise their guns to their shoulders when Newsom, one of them, said: Skinner, that nigger can really shoot. They brought their guns down as Andy had caught up with me. He wanted to know what the argument was. I told him: They want to take the hog. He said: John will be here in a minute. He will tell em off. Soon John and Russell came. Andy told John what was up.

Russell wanted to know why those fellows didnt like me. I explained that I am a Negro, and I hunted in their area. They just dont like Negroes. He said: Andys farther is a black man, pointing at Alf Cannon’s house down the canyon. He said: Everybody likes Andy. This was my opportunity to find the answer I wanted to know. I ask: How come Alf Cannon not to be lynched when it was discovered he had been dealing with a white woman? This is forbidden in the South, I am told. He said: I was a small boy when Andy was born. Nobody talked about it after the first month he was born. When Andy was born, they discovered he was a black baby. It started a hell of a stink. My Pa told us boys about it. There was a lot of men from Sherwood came here to hang Alf. But the three Cannon brothers turned these fellows back, threatening to kill anybody that touched Alf. In the time of slavery the Cannons had a small plantation down in the lowlands. They once owned most of these canyons. After the slaves were freed the six they owned never left them. Alf is one of the sons. He grew up with the three young Cannons. He was just like one in the family. Andy’s mother</line>

Alf went somewhere and got him a black woman. The Cannons gave him that farm. He has raised a family. Everybody in this canyon likes Alf. He dont have no black people friends. Five year later John Atkins married Andys mother. John has raised Andy and have a son of his own. He and Alf Cannon are friends. John would kill anybody that bothered Andy. Then he said: You know Sewanee has their own way of law for their black people. I have been told that the uppish white people there thinks more of the black people than they do of the poor white people. The say they dont call you people niggers like they do in other places in the South world. This was some of the cause of the mob to quiet down. He then said: We are not suppose to talk about this.

I couldnt hardly believe what my ears had heard, thinking Alf Cannon was the luckiest Negro in the South. Today was the twentieth of January, 1912. I had killed the largest game of my hunting, and had heard the strangest story of truth that could be told of the South. I envyed Andy. He didnt have no Negros around to call him a bastard. Shep and I had built a repertation. As much as twice a week we helpt some of the people run down hogs. He was the only dog that would go in the caves and bring them out. I was glad to do it for them, because this canyon was the only place in the South I have ever felt free. I had planned to build a cabin the next year. Shep and I was credited of not loosing a bog if once on his trail. The fifteenth of March I bid the canyon and all of my friends goodbye, not thinking I wouldnt ever see them again. I had made more money than I had ever dreamed of. I now reveal the activity in Sewanee in the past three months. There was a lot of entertainment given for the Negros such as cakewalks and festivals. I had gone to four with my sweetheart, having money to spend, wearing tailor-made clothes—the only boy that sported new clothes. The secret had leaked out about my foster brothers ailment.

I had hunted nearly every night. I would rest three hours on return from my traps. I had an area of about seven miles to hunt. There were four coves. I would hunt each one night a week. There was a cove named Thump and Dick. I gave up this cove. It was rugged and heavey folidiged. I was so frightened one night that I never cared to hunt it again. All hunters held some fear of this canyon. There were many destressing storys told about this place. I had explored this canyon twice in daytime. There were many small caves. There were many animal tracks that I just couldnt be sure they were dogs or huge cats, wild goats, wild hogs. It was narrow and deep and had a good stream. No one lived within two miles of it. There were no trails though it, just around the rim. I had gone down the first bench of the mountian. I heard a woman scream not far away. At least I thought it was a woman. I yelled as to answer. The scream came again. This time it was across the canyon. Soon the hounds struck a hot trail, and either bayed or treed on the other side of the canyon. I started across through the thick laurel bushes. I had gone fifty yards when a fight started, and then everything went silent.</line>

The most struggle of it all was stumbling over my dogs as they hovered around me. This was the only experience that I dont have a sound answer to. Speaking of experience, the mountaineres had many home remedies. This one may sound rare that I participated in—taking the fat of a skunk, and rendering the fat to oil. They gave it to children as a remedy for croupe, and whooping cough. Also it was supposed to be good for rhumatics. This I will agree. Because I had held the rifle in my right hand so much, this year rheumatism had affected my indext finger and thumb. Every morning it would be so stiff I would hope to catch a skunk. Before I would finish skinning it my finger would be supple. I rendered many pounds of skunk fat, traded it to the mountaineres for furs. This caused me, regaurdless of my incompatents, I analized the skunk. I found he lived mostly on insects like bees, yellow jackets, various herbs as well as meat. I arrived at this decision—he could be called a bit of a pharmacy animal. I was having many of the girls to slip out at night and go hunting with me. No one talked about the skunk oder.

I ran into trouble with the Tick Bush gang at Two Mile Branch on Washintons Birtheday. Jessie, my girl friend, had slipped out to hunt with me. The dogs had treed. We thought it was a coon.

I came to my feet to see there were four men. One had a shot gun. Skinner let his gun down, staring at her. Newsom said: Thats our game. Our dogs treed it. I ask her to give me the gun. She refused, saying: I can shoot, and will. Let them have the coon. No coon is worth trouble. If ever I surrendered to anything that hurt, this was it. I put my lantern out. We went into the undergrowth fifty yards away, and waited for them to get the animal out, so my dogs would come to us. It was a house cat. I heard them cursing it as they shot it. This was the first time I knew she knew about a gun. As she told me, she had been a tomboy with her three brothers. She hunted and fished with them. Then she said: You are the man I want. I love everything you do. We are going to get married, and we will be the finest colored couple Sewanee</line>

This was close to her home. The town Pelham: We had planned to surprise everybody… She was leaving the first of March… Tonight she persuaded me not to hunt alone any more… Pay some to go with me.. Troubles seem to start again from this night The next day Henry Prince stopt me and said I should stop carrying money on me to buy furs. Take a check book. There is some talk of robbing you. It means they will ambush you. Two days later I got a letter from Meridian Miss: From a little nurse I had dated last summer, saying I was the farther of her expected baby... Send for her... I had to marry her This grew to be a increasing program by the first of April... I went to my old men friends for advice, I didnt know what to do with this kind of trouble. They all giggled and made fun of it, saying What a man… Hugh Hill said Let the gals worry about it... It wasnt that easy for me… This was a burden I had to carry alone… </line>

This was at the foot of the Winchester road: I went from my run to their house… They had twelve dollars worth...Coming back. at Popular Springs a wild turkey crossed ahead of me. I ran after it, trying to get a shot... I came on a saddle: It was a fine. I hadnt seen anyone with one like it except Mr. Rosbourough... I carried it home It was much weather beaten...I cleaned it up with saddle soap. Hung it on the front porch… Hoping someone would claim it: Many people came to see it but for a month no one claimed it Uncle Rufus Mosley offered ten dollars for it I sold it to him with the understanding that if the owner should come for it, I would refund his money...I takened my girl friends advice. To get someone to hunt with me. Because in Greens View Cove I found. Paper tied on bushes. Reading Nigger, stay out of the mountains. I couldnt find no colored boys that wanted to hunt... The second of March… Will Roe… who lived next two door to us. Had three hogs he was to kill. One of them jumped the fence and ran into the woods... He had hired my cousin John Will Green a young fellow to help him. I had been to Jack Princes: I saw them chasing the hog. I caught up with them. I could see they</line>

It was a good shot…. John Will. came to me saying: Ill hunt with you if you will teach me to shoot like that... I said Thats a deal Ill teach you all I can… For the next two weeks. Every day he went with me. All he wanted to do was shoot the pistol at every tree he passed... I soon found he wanted to be a big bully... He was arogant. and full of hate. I couldnt see why. He was very dark. His mother and farther worshiped him... He twenty years old... They hadnt lived here more than a year... He didnt care for women... He liked to try to gamble. This had caused him to get beat up a couple of times... We confided to each other our greivences: and revenges. I was surprised when he told me of Negros had planned to rob me: And I missed this plans This of course made me feel closer to him... By time of two week we had agreed we would be as close as to people could be… We would stick togather no matter what... Of course I didnt know too much about him. I did know I needed someone for a friend… The season is over for traping and hunting. As I sized up my condition… It was like this: Scott my</line>

Ill fight my own battles by myself...I taken my job back at the Colmores. This ten dollars sure was slow pay. As I had made faster money: The morning after the Titanic sunk… Miss Dora Colmore told me about Major Butt going down with it... All of Sewanee was in mourning... This day I went to Farther Eastern: And told him about my troubles.  Asking him what should I do. I am accused four ways I am threatened to be prosecuted... The other has threaten to shoot me if I dont marry his daughter… explaining I dont believe it to be true... Father said Wait untill these children are born. Thats the only way to know…Neither one of the familys wanted to listen to this. This is when I told Mama. She layed me low with her tongue... I felt more freindless than ever… She didnt simpithize no way… although she did want me to marry anyone... By this time I didnt talk to no one. I was ready to fight any body... I felt ashame think I had created a bastard to suffer like I have...I was expecting the men to come back for the saddle. I had told Jack Prince about it he said they were lying. They never had enough money to buy one like that... Come to him if</line>

I want to kill all of them… Jack said I think you had better let me take your guns… or get that idea out of your mind. Henry Jacks son… said dads right, Ely. Fighting wont do... I agreed I was wrong: Jack said: They have to come by here if they come I will be there... I felt good to think I had some my friend…. I wanted to go to Magby. But he didnt like me although he hadnt bothered me about me shooting at McFarling... He knew all the high up white people all favored me... He would have to go to both my concilmans… Before he could arrest me. I paid Henry for the three loads he had delivered me and went home... The next night I taken my hound over to Shake Rag Hollow to let them have some exercise. There was a fox chase on... The fox came close to my dogs the become excited and got in the chase. They had this before... It always made these mountainers angry. Because the English hound were so fast they would put a grey fox in a hole within and hour… Two days later. I was sawing wood. when five of the Tick Bushers rode up to my gate... Three of them had rifles... I thought they were coming for the saddle: Hell</line>

He said We came here to look at your dogs teeth. They got on our fox run the other night. We found three of our sheep killed yesterday your dogs was in our district. We want to see if your dogs have sheep wool in their teeth... I said: If that is what you want to do go and look for yourself... My rifle was sitting behind the tree close to me… He went to the dogs pen and opened the gate White and Laura: my two breed dog and trained dog went to him... He looked in the mouths and came out went to his mule untied his rifle and came back in the gate. I ask What are you going to do with that gun: He said I am going to kill the dogs they got sheep wool in their teeth. I stepped forward with my rifle at hip action: saying the first man shoots a dog, I shoot him… Drop that rifle... He did. Just here Jack Prince rode up... He listen for a minute to what I was saying: as I told them. It is not your job to kill other peoples dogs... You go and get Magby the constable… Then Jack ask them whats going on.

You go like he ask. and get Magby… They wasnt gone long before they were back. The three with guns came back with Magby... Jack came in the yard, and sat between the two piles of wood. He said I want to be here when they come back. He said. I saw them as they passed my house. I had to sadle up before I could start I thought they were headed here... I dont blame you for not letting them destroy your fine dogs. They are just begruging... All they do is make trouble… As they rode up. Magby was with three of them the ones that had guns... Magby dismounted and open the gate I walked to the porch which placed me direct in front of them. Magby said. Boy, are you crazy… Dont you know better than to threaten people with a gun… I am going to examine those dogs. If they have wool in their teeth I will shoot. Thats the law… I spoke then saying Mr. Magby, you can examine my dogs, but you wont kill no dog of mine. Any man kill a dog of mine I kill him… Because the law is the dog must be gotton ridd of.

I mean to protect every dam thing I own law or no law… One of the riders said I going to kill that nigger. He started to lift his rifle from the saddle I yelled at him not to raise that gun... Magby shouted at me. Dont point that gun at me. Put it down... I said Do you think I am going to let those suns of bitches shoot me. He looked back at them and shook his head: I didnt know Mama had come out of the house and on the porch back of me… Untill Magby said to her. Mat the white people gave you that boy to raise… Is this the way you raised him not to have any respect for white people or law: At that moment Mama reached over my shoulder and snatched my rifle. Slamming the stock down on the bannister breaking it. And said Pull your shirt off. I am going to give you licking of your life… No one had noticed Jack sitting by the wood pile… As I was pulling my shirt over my head, I heard Jack shout dont one of you raise a gun… I mean dont attempt to shoot that boy Mama taken the hitch rein to my halter a one inch sea grass rope it had wire wrapped ends that held the ravel.

When he spoke. He said My son I think this can be a solution to all of your problems… Go away for a while… at least six month... You are most bitter. And leave today. Do you have money: I said yes sixty dollars… He said Write me… so I can have a Father to look after you... I told him I would… I saw at once.

He explained that many riders had passed our house untill eight oclock: Magby came and talk to Mama. Telling her not to talk to no colored people about your trouble: as not any of them knew about it. I am going to take you to Cowan myself... There is a work car at top of Popluar Spring Canyon. Its a heavy one. I think we can get it on the track... The grade starts down there. It will skate down to Cowan. We will leave here at two oclock: No one will be stirring at that hour... We can skirt the town: Go through the S.M.A… campus Then head for the railroad… He said get some sleep. You will need it I found myself feeling close to him for the first time. He said I wish some of them would try to stop us. I brought your pistol with me. I would like to put a blaze under them sager. I knew how he hated a sager…. I had lost all the desire to fight after recieving the blessing from Father... I couldnt sleep. For thinking of about how the outer world would be. Also I regretted Uncle John Will had said I would come to a no good end… I hope John Will Jr. will change his mind about wanting kill people… But little did I think he would be the first colored person to go to the prison from</line>

I have for the last two years worried about you. I have expected to hear of you having trouble. ore shooting some­ body. I have wished that you hadnt ever seen a gun… Uncle Doss said if it hadnt been that He is as good a shot as he is, he wouldnt be living… As I stood there, I began to feel lonely. For the first since I had talked to my mother at the waterfall five years ago… It seemed I was being stripped of invisible clothing and my soul was bare to the world… I suppose all people feel that way when leaveing a world they loved like I loved Sewanee and the mountains… I had always believed that this ten thousand acres… Represented the Greatness of God... It wasnt long before it was definitely comfirmed that my feeling an thoughts of Sewanee were true... I didnt know at this time the greatness of Sewanee would. be my guide on the life journey walking the third path of tradition: On our way to the railroad we didnt meet a person... On the way I told Uncle Doss that I could go by myself… We had a hard time getting the heavy cart on the rails...</line>

                  <line>I looked back at Uncle Doss. knowing he had hept me get started away. He was as glad to see me go as any one. The cart moved very slow untill I passed the home of the Sisters of chastity then the grade dropped. I hated to leave these mountains I knew so well. I knew they were a part of me would I ever see them again: I loved every foot of this beautiful area: I was praying some to. When I realized it the cart was increasing speed every second. I became worried how could I stay on this flat car going around the curves at this rate of speed. I almost lost my suit case when it slide away from me holdin with one hand I just barely caught the hand grip with two fingers to hold it long enough for the cart to straiten, sending it back against me almost. Pushing me off the cart. I could that I had a strait strip of road for a distance I knew there was no getting off of this cart untill I was at the end of this track... All at once I knew my life was facing a gamble if I made it. I knew the surges would come from each side I quickly placed my suitcase center of the cart Then lyig across it hooking toes to the side of the cart, holding the other with hands. soon I was in the bends of the road. It was a struggle to hold on. the cart was flying I didnt see how it could stay on the track This lasted for about ten minutes. Which seemed like an eternity to me. Trying to look ahead me it was hard to breath. I hadnt ever rode this fast even on the train. I cant say that I was scared. Really I didnt care too much about what could happen: I knew thisI ame my free and my own man. I said several times I have got to make it all of a sudden I came out on a rim of the mountain. I saw Cowan below I knew I had made it there was one</line>

                  <line>more trying curve almost like a horse bend. This one I had to hold on with my toes I was tired I relaxed for a few moments when I passed over the tunnel of the N. and C. main line I tightened my grip to the cart again the surge was on stronger than ever: I managed to last it through.  Then the road gradualy came down paralell the main line track for a mile. The cart was still traveling at a high rate of speed I knew I had to stop it some way ore jump off before reaching the switch: I had on heavy sole shoes. I chanced falling off by sitting on the edge so as to press my foot against the wheel as a brake. This checked the cart effectively untill my was burning painfully. The cart stopped about fifty yards from the switch. I tried to get the cart off the track. I couldnt. I knew there wouldnt be a train along untill seven oclock in the morning. I left it and walked to the station: Wondering why did Uncle Doss put me on a cart with a brake on it he was a railroad man and knew this road like a book. did he mean to kill me this way: I wont ever know because I wont ever see him again: I am alive. My foot was paining when I reached the station. No one except the ticket agent was in the station. When walked in I looked at the clock on the wall it read three twenty five… I had come this eight miles in twenty minutes on a flat cart: down the winding road of the mountains: I sat down in the sitting room for a few minutes to think. All I could think of was that the mountains had taken care me untill now: Just then the adgent was much like most of the poor class of white people he poked his head in the window and said where did you come from this time of morning I said what time will the next train be coming through to Nashville. He said Cannon Ball</line>

I went to the window, and ask him to give me a ticket. to Waxahachie, Texas: I want to catch this next train: He said nigger, are you running from trouble. What have you done How did you get here this time of morning I havent heard a sound of a horses foot. You must have walked a distance. I ask again will you sell me a ticket. He hesitated a moment. Then said yes thats my job. You are just a boy. I could be wrong. But every time I have sold a ticket to Texas this time of morning. The comes looking for them: I went in the toilet room and changed clothes My shoe I had used to brake with the sole was burned badly. The shoe was no good all I had like shoes was a pair of dancing pumps. I put them on as I dreseed in a blue serge suit boxed back peg tops pants a soft white flannel white hat with a purple band. like the Sewanee student wore: When I ask for my ticket. I ask the adgent how long would it be before the train arrive he looked at and said she will be here in the next two minute. I will try to stop her then he said you are a Sewanee nigger I can tell the way they dress They all are high collard: and proud, just like them dam white people up there on that mountain. They dont have no use for a poor white man. And I dont have any use for them. He said I have signaled for her to stop get out there because she will barely stop you might have to swing on. The train allmost passed the station before stopping I caught the last coach with the help of the porter taking my suitcase from me as I kept up with the moving train. I swung on. This was the first time I had seen a Pullman coach,</line>

                  <line>this was one that I had entered. The porter looked at my ticket and said follow me you go to the day coach. We had to go through many Pullmans before we reached a chair car. The porter said you are a Sewanee boy I said yes I know them when I see them. No one wears a hat like that except them I have had the teams many times. He placed my suitcase in the rack and said this is your chair. I sat down: He went to the next coach. I looked around me every body was white. No colored anywhere: I knew this porter had made a mistake in thinking that I was a white school boy: evedently a cadet: I did’nt have any intension of making my identity known just now. I pulled my hat down tight as I could on my head to keep my sandy curly from showing too much no one would descover that I am a Negro: In the morning, I would go to the colored coach: I laid back in the chair and began to review the nights events. How every thing in the world had changed within the last three days: How fast I had moved about in two hours So many times I had heard the whispers coming from some where saying out there out there. I am out there. I know I am going to see. hear. and do. things I never knew of: There in Texas I wont be called bastard, Clabber ore nigger: Like that sager ticket agent at Cowan called me. I thought of what a Negro said in Alabama. That a Southern sager could smell Negro blood in a person no matter how white he was. I remember how quick that agent discovered. I was a Negro the moment I walked into the sitting room: this porter a Negro him self dont know I am a Negro: I had heard Ann say that when you are traveling act as in Roam. She traveld two day in a white coach No one knew the diffirence. I finally decided. that I didnt ask to be here. I had obeyed the</line>

All they will do is tell me to go to the Negro car: I began to think of every friend I had left in Sewanee: I began to wonder what I will do to make a living in Texas I will miss Mr Colmore Mr Rosbourough Jack Prince, and Johnny McKay: I didnt tell them good bye. These friends had been much of a part in my life. Scott Mamas oldest son improving with his health: He will soon go to work on the Saint Agustus project: I will send her money. When I make some. She can sell my guns my fine dogs: As I looked out the window, I could see the dawn was aproaching. This was a sacrad hour to when in the mountain: This was the last time I held any thought of my life I had left behind me: The porter came through and said Nashville in fifteen minute:</line>
