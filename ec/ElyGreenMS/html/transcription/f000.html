			<tei-line data-origname="line">My father was a white man. My mother was so called</tei-line>

			<tei-line data-origname="line">and so called that by almost every one that knew me:</tei-line>

			<tei-line data-origname="line">often taken Negro boys-girl into their homes to train</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">them to be effecient help. This is how my mother</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">became a victim of this misfortune by producing me</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">when she was seventeen. She descovered she was pregnet</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Her mistress sent her away. For me to be born.</tei-line>
