			<tei-line data-origname="line">I was born in a Small town in Tenn the name Sewanee:</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">So called. The University of the South. It was was 1893.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">My father was a white man. My mother was so called</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">a negress. So I was looked on as a half white bastard</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">and so called that by almost every one that knew me:</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">.In. this town many of the better class of white people,</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">often taken Negro boys-girl into their homes to train</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">them to be effecient help. This is how my mother</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">became a victim of this misfortune by producing me</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">when she was seventeen. She descovered she was pregnet</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Her mistress sent her away. For me to be born.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">After this event. My mother was taken in by another family.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">by the name of Dr. Richerson. Who lived. next estate</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to my fathers people: I have never known. Jest why</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">this kind couple should have so thoutful to mother.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">They treated her as if she was one of the family. When I was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">two years old my mother married. Then she brought</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me to live on the estate with her. and husband</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I was about three years old before I can remember</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">things that went on about me: My step father</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was a fine man. He was so good to me although</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I became to know that he was not my father at</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">four years old. Chrismas 1897. Usally my mother</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">taken me up to mother Richeson to work every day</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">their I would Play all over the house.. Mother Richeson</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was very fond of me. She done lots of hand work</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">When I would do thinks wrong. She would. say</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I drop a stitch find it there I would crawl over the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">floor. hunting for the stitch. While both mothers</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">would laugh; So this Xmas there was to be company</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">for dinner. So my mother thought I would be in</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the way of the guest. So She explained this to me,</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Santa Claus had brought me some fire works</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">and toys I was most happy. She ask me to stay in</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the servent quarters: until after dinner. And dont</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">touch the fire works: She dressed me in a little</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">plaid dress. And told me to stay in the house it was</tei-line>

			<tei-line data-origname="line">She came back ever hour to see how I was: The stove.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was red from heat: So holding a roman candle in my hand</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">playing with it I let it touch the stove. And it lighted</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">and started to Sparkle. I tried to put it out it set my</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">dress afire. I ran to the door and threw the candle out I was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">on fire. not knowing what to. I leapt in the bed and covered it.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">This put the fire out: Later I got up and changed .dresses and hid</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">my burned dress in my box where I kept my clothes: Soon my</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">mother came with my dinner. like most all the cooks down</tei-line>

			<tei-line data-origname="line">try. run me down to get me back in the house. before she could</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">reach me I had crawled through the bars of the big gate to the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">adjoyning estate: That belong to my father people. There I</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">stood screaming. My mother stood coaxing me to come</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">back to her: She didn't wish to come through gate:</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Some one spoke from the back of me. Asking my mother</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">what was she whipping me for. Mother replied he lied</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to me and I spanked him and he ran away from me</tei-line>

			<tei-line data-origname="line">I began to love every body: Hear I wish to explain</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">somthing about this town. As why the white people</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">were so democratic. Most of the people at this time</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">that lived here. Were English decent. There many of them</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">were nobility respect of England: The residental area was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">fenced in no poor white people lived in side of this area:</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">No body lived there except the aristicrats and their servants.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">all work s like house maids Butlers coachmans were all.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">colored and most every one was call colored you</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">rarely ever heard the word ever used negro are nigger.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">It seemed that every body was happy just to be there</tei-line>

		<tei-surface facs="#f004" data-origname="surface">
			<tei-line data-origname="line">When I was five years old my little brother was born.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">In which. I became jelouis of imeditately. It seemed every</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">thing changed. Every way. People came to our house to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to see my little brother: Every one colored was so fond of.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">him. Until this happend: There were so few women</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">ever come to see my mother: There were but few ever</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">had anything. To say to me. They would just look at</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me as if I could not have been. My white family was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">named Wicks. Some of the women would say to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the other he sure is a Wicks. He is just like them:</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">by the time I was Six Year old: I had become to under</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">stand that I just was nt like the rest of my family</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I know my mother had become to notice my feeling. Though</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">she did not say anything to me concerning this: They gave</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me more priviledges. I was allowed to go out in the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">park and play withe the white children. when their</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">nurses brought then in the Park to play. many</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">times the mother s would come with their children. They</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">were all so kind to me you see the town was so</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">no houses had any numbers. every body knew</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">every body Black ore white: The white people had</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">every thing under such control. They knew every thing</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">so that was why that it seemed that every one knew</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me and was so kind to me: So often they would</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">bring ice crem cookies. I would be sirved with their</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">children: This went on for about six months. Then my</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">mother told me that school was opening out of the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">corporation and I should go. This was where most</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">of the colored people and the poor class of white</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">lived. So the first day she taken me to school so</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I would know the way. I met the teecher. and I was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">enrolled: For two weeks, I went to school. I did not</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">like school. Because the children didnt like me</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I was the only real light complected one in</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the school. The rumer soon was out that I was a</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Bastard and that my white uncle was a knit witt</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">whome was called Clabber: Soon all the children</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">joked fun at me of this name: which vexed me very</tei-line>
		</tei-surface>
		<tei-surface facs="#f005" data-origname="surface">
			<tei-line data-origname="line">much: My teacher was very kind to untill I started</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to fight the kids when the the would tease me: I was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">graded: placed in the second Reader: Just as I was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">begenning to be come adjusted my mother taken</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">sick. She wanted me to stay with her. She had been</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">ailing every sice my brother was born. She never</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">went back to work. So I was glad not to go to school.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">My mother was aflected with consumption: she know</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">She would never be well. This four month before</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">She got to weak she kept me with her almost every</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">minute: She would take my brother and and go up on</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the main streets when the military student would</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">march. by. I thought that was the greatest somthing</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">that could be: To be a cadet. She talked so much about</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">this training. Sundy morning the cadets would march.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">by music. by their band. like the West Point.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Cadets. So on Sundy mornings I would go up on</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the street where they marched by: I was just two</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">blocks from St Agustus Chapel. Which they had to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">march from where I would meet them. So I would</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">try to keep up with them untill they got to the chapel.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">formation. Passing reveiw and salute their superiors.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I would stand some where and solute to.  Then march.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">in the chapel. Every body always waited for the arival</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">of the cadets before going in the chapel. When they</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">marched in. I wouldnt go in the I would to the back</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">of the chapel to watch the orogan pumper pump the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">pipe organ. I would wath him for a while. Then</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I would go to my mother. After a few Sundays I</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was spoken to by many white people; All white people</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">down South seems to love colored children. So one</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">morning their was a package left on our door step</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I brought it in and gave it to my mother She open it</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">their was a little coat and cap somthing like the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">cadets: So Sundy mornings I was always waiting</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">for cadets to pass. Seem every body would laugh.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">when I pass by they would salute me when I salute</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">them. I do beleaive that was the happiest days of all</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">my life:</tei-line>

		<tei-surface facs="#f006" data-origname="surface">
			<tei-line data-origname="line">On Sundays my step father would be home with my</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">mother. That was why I could go away for a while:</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I would come in and tell her how wonderful things</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">were. Very soon my mother became so sick that I</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">could not wait on her: Father had to get some.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">one a woman to care for. I had my little brother</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">then to look after: Father built another room on</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to the one we had been living in where we cooked</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">slept and bathed in: Father Gerry come Pastor of</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">St Agustus came every morning. He and Dr Hall.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Father would pray: And before he would he would</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">leave. he would talk to me telling to stay close to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">her. many of the white family would drive up in</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">carrages bringing somthing for her. They were</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">so genorous in every way. So one morning</tei-line>

			<tei-line data-origname="line">Just here is the first time I had to learn something</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">about religions: I hadnt ever seen may mother</tei-line>

			<tei-line data-origname="line">streaming down their faces. Mother held out her</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">hands saying bring my two sons to me. I turned</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">around to get my brother who was crawling in the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">door. I carried him to the bed one of the sisters put him</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">in the bed and I climbed in. Mother as feble as she was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">pulled us both against her breast and folded</tei-line>

			<tei-line data-origname="line">his left hand he stroke her brow softly. The word s</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">he spoke I cant remember. then he knelt by the bed</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">with me and the lady nurse. There he prayed and talked</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">with her. Mother spoke then, asking him what should</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">be done with Ely. I know I am going die. Eddie he has a father</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to look after him. Ely as he is you know hasnt</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">any one. I now can die happy when I know that he will</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">be cared for. Farther then spoke saying Lena you know</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">that Bishop Gaylor is Elys Godfather and I am his</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">conselor. and Farther Eastern. He will be taken care of.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Who do you think he could live with Mother told</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">him to send for Matty Davis. Whom she had</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">lived with when she was a girl. Father waited</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">untill I went for her and came back.</tei-line>
		</tei-surface>
		<tei-surface facs="#f008" data-origname="surface">
			<tei-line data-origname="line">There was agreed. That Matty Davis would raise me.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">My mother was very happy. Father Gerray told Mother</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Matty that she would have help if she needed it.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">This was the begining of a new life for me: I left with</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">her. That was the last time I saw my mother alive.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">She died the next day. My brother and his father moved</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">out of the corporation. To where most of the colored people</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">lived: soon he married again. My foster mother cooked</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">for Dr. Barton. They let her keep me on the estate. They</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">were very kind to me. I was then allowed to go almost</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">anywhere I wanted to go. I would go to Father Gerrays</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">house every day to play with the children. Mother Mat</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">had three children one girl two boys. Her childre were</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">grown: She owned a house where they lived. Neither</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">of them were married. I soon became to love her.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">and daughters as if they were my own. When I was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">eight years old. Mama Matty decided. I should go</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to school. So we stop staying at night in the corporation</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">she would go home: School did not open as was expected.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">So I would go to and frow. With her to work and</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to play with the white children. I often would go to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">building where my step father worked. To see him</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I loved him. He loved me to I knew. He was so kind</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">everybody that knew him loved him white or black. He</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was so strong I just loved to be close to him. He was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">said to be the strongest man in the county. It was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">often he would display his strenth by lifting. To</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">amuse the students who liked to watch him. His job</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">mostly was to wind the derick for the stone setters.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Just as I was turning nine. This was where things</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">began to change for me and happiness faded:</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">All this time my frienships had broadend. To where</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">almost every notable in town knew me many of</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">them would stop on the street and would talk to me.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I was taught by Mother to be curtious to every one</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">People liked me for this often told me that. I hadnt</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">ever thought any thing about race destinction.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I knew very little about colored children. The word Negro</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was rarely ever used, or I just didnt pay any attention</tei-line>
		</tei-surface>
		<tei-surface facs="#f009" data-origname="surface">
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I had the dream that some day I would be like the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">students. I would be a cadet. All the white kids talked of</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">this we drilled and played to gather happily I didnt</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">only go to Father Gerrys house. I would go to any</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">ones house that had children. Have lunch. All these</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">mothers were kind to me. One morning I went to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Mother Gerrys to play. It was cold outside. There</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">wasn’t any children except her own around. Mother</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">said to us: The leaves has blown over the yard.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">If you boys will rake them up. I will give fifteen</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">cents each. The job was soon done. When she paid us</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">out to the drug store we went. To buy an egg flip which was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">a drink like a malted milk. Alexander, Edward and I.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">We went to the dispencer. And ordered three drinks.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I had been here before many times with these children.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">And got drinks even men and women had given</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me drinks because I had no money. Dr. Conger the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">propiator never said anything. This day there was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">a new disspencer that I hadnt seen before. So he made</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">two drinks. Handed one to Alexander another one to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Edward. Didnt make any for me. I ask where was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">my drink. He said You don’t get any: Alexander</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">spoke up why don’t Ely get a drink he has money to pay</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">for it. The dispencer said I don’t make drinks for no</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">nigger. He is a nigger. Alexander said he is one of us.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">The fellow said I wouldnt make a drink for a nigger</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">if I never worked. The boys both tossed their glasses</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">over the counter and out of the store we went back</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">home. This was the first time I ever felt hurt except</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">when my mother died: We were just a block from</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the Gerry home. We didnt talk at all on the way</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">home. Alexander was two years older than I. and</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was older than Edward. I am not sure that Alexander</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">did not have more understanding about this than</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">we did. When we entered the house Alexander</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">and Sumner went strait to their room. I walked to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the libary where Mother Gerry and Annie was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the libary where Mother Gerry and Annie was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">at me and said did you boys have a nice drink.</tei-line>
		</tei-surface>
		<tei-surface facs="#f010" data-origname="surface">
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I said no I didnt have a drink the clerk wouldn’t make</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me a drink. He called me a niggir and said he did</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">not make drinks for niggirs: Mother stop looking</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">at me and looked toward the fire. I stood there for</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">a moment. Then I ask her Mother what is a nigger.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">She did not answer. She walked tothe hall and</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">called the two boys to come to the libiary they came</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">she said I have some cookies and will make some</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">hot cholate. You dont have to go to the drug store.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">No one said anything. She went to the kitchen. I</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">followed her. While she was heating the milk.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I could see that she was a bit purturbed. Then I ask</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">her would she please tell me what is a nigger.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Why should I be called a nigger. It must be very</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">bad to be a nigger. She stood with her back to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me fully a minute. Before she spoke. She turned</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">and faced me. She said Ely I think this is a job</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">for Father: you go to him. He can explain this</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">better than I can. He is over at St. Agustus. For three years</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I had been coming to her for understanding. This was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the first time she refused to explain to me. I did not</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">wait for choclate. I went over to St. Agustus Father</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Gerry was in his study. He was writing.He looked</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">up and said Ely my boy what brings you here. I said</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Father there is something I want to ask you if you</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">have time. He said Have a seat there. Ill talk to you in a</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">minute: I waited soon he said I am preparing this for class</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">and lecture this afternoon. Now what is it you</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">want to know: Ely. I stood up. Then I said Father</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I want to know what is a nigger. I was called that</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">by the clerk over at the drugstore. He would not take my</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">money. Mother Gerry said I should come to you for</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">explanation. He started to say something and stopted,</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">just for a moment. Then he said Ely. I am very busy. I have</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">this lecture to do so I will send you to Father Eastern</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">tell him. I sent you and he will explain to you</tei-line>
