			<tei-line data-origname="line">All at once there was a scream. Which I knew it</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">mothers voice. I rushed in the house. There my</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">mother was sitting up in bed. Clapping hands saying</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Glory Hallalula. I been born again I rushed to her</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">as she said my son I am now happy. I didnt know</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">what it all ment. As I looked at all six people with tears</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">streaming down their faces. Mother held out her</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">hands saying bring my two sons to me. I turned</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">around to get my brother who was crawling in the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">door. I carried him to the bed one of the sisters put him</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">in the bed and I climbed in. Mother as feble as she was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">pulled us both against her breast and folded</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">back on her pillar say God bless them I can</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">now die happy. As she ran her feeble fingers through</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the curls of my hair saying over and over. He</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">leadeth me through green pastures and lie me</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">down by still waters I will not fear to enter</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the vally of death. I will not be alone. Soon she</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was in a coma: I was going over to Father Gerry.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I was told that Mother had confessed religion.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">When met Father Gerry I told him of this.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Father took me by hand and said lets go to her</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">at once. When we arrived every one of the colored</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">people had gone. No one was there except Mother and her</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">nurse. Father Gerry walked to her bedside. With</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">his left hand he stroke her brow softly. The word s</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">he spoke I cant remember. then he knelt by the bed</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">with me and the lady nurse. There he prayed and talked</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">with her. Mother spoke then, asking him what should</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">be done with Ely. I know I am going die. Eddie he has a father</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to look after him. Ely as he is you know hasnt</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">any one. I now can die happy when I know that he will</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">be cared for. Farther then spoke saying Lena you know</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">that Bishop Gaylor is Elys Godfather and I am his</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">conselor. and Farther Eastern. He will be taken care of.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Who do you think he could live with Mother told</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">him to send for Matty Davis. Whom she had</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">lived with when she was a girl. Father waited</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">untill I went for her and came back.</tei-line>
