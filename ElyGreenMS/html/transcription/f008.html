			<tei-line data-origname="line">There was agreed. That Matty Davis would raise me.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">My mother was very happy. Father Gerray told Mother</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Matty that she would have help if she needed it.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">This was the begining of a new life for me: I left with</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">her. That was the last time I saw my mother alive.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">She died the next day. My brother and his father moved</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">out of the corporation. To where most of the colored people</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">lived: soon he married again. My foster mother cooked</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">for Dr. Barton. They let her keep me on the estate. They</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">were very kind to me. I was then allowed to go almost</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">anywhere I wanted to go. I would go to Father Gerrays</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">house every day to play with the children. Mother Mat</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">had three children one girl two boys. Her childre were</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">grown: She owned a house where they lived. Neither</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">of them were married. I soon became to love her.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">and daughters as if they were my own. When I was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">eight years old. Mama Matty decided. I should go</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to school. So we stop staying at night in the corporation</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">she would go home: School did not open as was expected.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">So I would go to and frow. With her to work and</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to play with the white children. I often would go to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">building where my step father worked. To see him</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I loved him. He loved me to I knew. He was so kind</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">everybody that knew him loved him white or black. He</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was so strong I just loved to be close to him. He was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">said to be the strongest man in the county. It was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">often he would display his strenth by lifting. To</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">amuse the students who liked to watch him. His job</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">mostly was to wind the derick for the stone setters.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Just as I was turning nine. This was where things</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">began to change for me and happiness faded:</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">All this time my frienships had broadend. To where</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">almost every notable in town knew me many of</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">them would stop on the street and would talk to me.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I was taught by Mother to be curtious to every one</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">People liked me for this often told me that. I hadnt</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">ever thought any thing about race destinction.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I knew very little about colored children. The word Negro</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was rarely ever used, or I just didnt pay any attention</tei-line>
