			<tei-line data-origname="line">When I was five years old my little brother was born.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">In which. I became jelouis of imeditately. It seemed every</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">thing changed. Every way. People came to our house to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">to see my little brother: Every one colored was so fond of.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">him. Until this happend: There were so few women</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">ever come to see my mother: There were but few ever</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">had anything. To say to me. They would just look at</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me as if I could not have been. My white family was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">named Wicks. Some of the women would say to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the other he sure is a Wicks. He is just like them:</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">by the time I was Six Year old: I had become to under</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">stand that I just was nt like the rest of my family</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I know my mother had become to notice my feeling. Though</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">she did not say anything to me concerning this: They gave</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me more priviledges. I was allowed to go out in the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">park and play withe the white children. when their</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">nurses brought then in the Park to play. many</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">times the mother s would come with their children. They</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">were all so kind to me you see the town was so</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">no houses had any numbers. every body knew</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">every body Black ore white: The white people had</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">every thing under such control. They knew every thing</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">so that was why that it seemed that every one knew</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me and was so kind to me: So often they would</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">bring ice crem cookies. I would be sirved with their</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">children: This went on for about six months. Then my</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">mother told me that school was opening out of the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">corporation and I should go. This was where most</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">of the colored people and the poor class of white</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">lived. So the first day she taken me to school so</tei-line>

			<tei-line data-origname="line">enrolled: For two weeks, I went to school. I did not</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">like school. Because the children didnt like me</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I was the only real light complected one in</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the school. The rumer soon was out that I was a</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Bastard and that my white uncle was a knit witt</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">whome was called Clabber: Soon all the children</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">joked fun at me of this name: which vexed me very</tei-line>
