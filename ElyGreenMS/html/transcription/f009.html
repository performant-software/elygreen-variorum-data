			<tei-line data-origname="line">I had the dream that some day I would be like the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">students. I would be a cadet. All the white kids talked of</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">this we drilled and played to gather happily I didnt</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">only go to Father Gerrys house. I would go to any</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">ones house that had children. Have lunch. All these</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">mothers were kind to me. One morning I went to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Mother Gerrys to play. It was cold outside. There</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">wasn’t any children except her own around. Mother</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">said to us: The leaves has blown over the yard.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">If you boys will rake them up. I will give fifteen</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">cents each. The job was soon done. When she paid us</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">out to the drug store we went. To buy an egg flip which was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">a drink like a malted milk. Alexander, Edward and I.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">We went to the dispencer. And ordered three drinks.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">I had been here before many times with these children.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">And got drinks even men and women had given</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">me drinks because I had no money. Dr. Conger the</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">propiator never said anything. This day there was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">a new disspencer that I hadnt seen before. So he made</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">two drinks. Handed one to Alexander another one to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">Edward. Didnt make any for me. I ask where was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">my drink. He said You don’t get any: Alexander</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">spoke up why don’t Ely get a drink he has money to pay</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">for it. The dispencer said I don’t make drinks for no</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">nigger. He is a nigger. Alexander said he is one of us.</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">The fellow said I wouldnt make a drink for a nigger</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">if I never worked. The boys both tossed their glasses</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">over the counter and out of the store we went back</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">home. This was the first time I ever felt hurt except</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">when my mother died: We were just a block from</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the Gerry home. We didnt talk at all on the way</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">home. Alexander was two years older than I. and</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">was older than Edward. I am not sure that Alexander</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">did not have more understanding about this than</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">we did. When we entered the house Alexander</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">and Sumner went strait to their room. I walked to</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the libary where Mother Gerry and Annie was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">the libary where Mother Gerry and Annie was</tei-line>
			<tei-line data-origname="line">at me and said did you boys have a nice drink.</tei-line>
